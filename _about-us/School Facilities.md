The Champions’ Lodge was officially launched in October 2017. It was designed to provide a physical space for all Brooksians to unwind during after-school hours. The design of the space such as the flooring, wall colour, layout and choice of recreational activities was conceptualised by our very own Brooksians. In addition, it is a platform whereby meaningful activities and programmes such as workshops and games will be introduced to engage students after school. The slogan of the space is ‘By Champions, For Champions’ which is the reason why the physical space is also a platform to develop a culture of peer leadership among the students who have been tasked to run the centre. This selected group of students were elected as an executive committee and are in charge of running the lodge. For instance, the students were also involved in the publicity and execution of the official launch in October.

The student committee decided on the slogan ‘For Champions, by Champions’ and it guided them in deciding the type of activities that will take place in the lodge. Presently, the room has a variety of activities that engage students, such as a pool table, foosball tables, game consoles, board games, dart board and a reading corner. In 2018, engaging and interesting workshops will be introduced to all Brooksians.   

  

On 20th October 2017, School Advisory Committee Chairman, Mr. William Choo, officially launched Champions’ Lodge. To create a fun-filled atmosphere, the teachers and students designed several table games and activities such as a lucky draw and a photo booth. In addition, representatives from the student committee led members of the School Advisory Committee on a tour of the physical space.

  

The Champions’ Lodge welcomes all Brooksians to visit the space and to interact with fellow Brooksians through a variety of engaging activities and interesting workshops.

### Arts Space

Officially opened on 20 October 2017, the Arts Space introduces an additional, permanent feature that recognises the efforts to develop and cultivate an arts appreciation amongst our students while at the same time, flourish a vibrant culture of the arts in school. 

  

Aimed at providing a proper and common space for students to showcase artistic works, the Arts Space becomes a stepping stone for our students who are exploring their potential at performing before venturing to perform for a wider audience. The small and intimate setting is also an informal gathering space for students to interact and express their creative talents and interests after curriculum time.

Situated next to the Music Room, the Arts Space is utilised by students undergoing the General Music Programme (GMP). The Space transforms into a hive of student activities during Music lessons as students rehearse their presentations and simulate real stage performances. 

The Arts Space also supports the showcase of visual art works. During the Post-Examination Activity (PEA) week recently, the Space was one of the venues to host the annual Brooksian Art Exhibition entitled **_SOARTS_**. 

  

The Arts Space certainly sees itself as one of the arenas in developing and grooming potentials in the arts.

The following information is provided by Nparks and summaries the environmental, economic, social and aesthetic benefits of a Vertical Greenery.

**Environmental**

*   Vertical greenery can alleviate heat islands by shading heat-absorbing surfaces.
*   It improves air quality by absorbing airborne particles.
*   It also enhances biodiversity in the city by providing additional natural habitats.

  

**Economic**

*   Vertical greenery optimises space that would otherwise have remained unused.  
    It also serves as insulation, cooling the building and leading to savings on air conditioning cost.

  

**Social**

*   Vertical greenery promotes a sense of ownership and fosters community interaction.

  

**Aesthetic**

*   Vertical greenery enhances the aesthetic appeal of a building and helps to soften the artificial urban landscape and provide visual relief from the concretised environment.
