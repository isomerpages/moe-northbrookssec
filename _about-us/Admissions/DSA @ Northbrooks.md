<h1>DSA @ Northbrooks</h1>
<p>Thank you for your interest in Northbrooks Secondary School.</p>
<h3>About DSA</h3>
<p>The Direct School Admission (DSA) is an opportunity for Primary 6 students
to directly apply for admission into participating secondary schools based
on their talents and achievement which might not have been demonstrated
at the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE). &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Northbrooks Secondary School</strong>&nbsp;offers DSA in the following
areas in 2025:
<br>
</p>
<p>1. Aerospace (Clubs &amp; Societies) &nbsp;
<br>2. Outdoor Adventure (Sports)&nbsp;
<br>3. Floorball Boys (Sports)&nbsp; 4. Badminton (Sports)&nbsp;
<br>5. Guzheng Ensemble (Visual and Performing Arts)&nbsp;
<br>6. Modern Dance (Visual and Performing Arts)&nbsp;

<p>Our <strong>Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Outdoor Education </strong>is
known as A.C.E. and stands for Adventure, Character, Environment. The programme
aims to develop character, inculcate values of grit and resilience and
build leadership traits in all students as they learn adventure skills
such as orienteering, rock climbing and abseiling as well as cultivate
an appreciation for the outdoors and the environment during PE lessons
and Level Camps. Students who excel at the various adventure skills may
have the opportunity to participate at a higher challenge level in various
outdoor competitions.&nbsp;</p>
