<u> About Northbrooks </u>

  

The school offers a variety of enrichment programmes to widen the students' learning experiences for greater development in cognitive, physical and aesthetics domains.   
  
The school's distinctive Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Aerospace provides our students an edge when applying for Aerospace-related courses in ITE and the Polytechnics, which in turn opens a career pathway for them in the rapidly growing Aerospace industry. All Lower Secondary students are equipped with basic knowledge in general Aerospace topics and essential Science Technology Engineering Mathematics (STEM) skills. Students who demonstrate passion in this field of study would be further engaged/stretched in related external competitions and programmes.   
  
Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Outdoor Education is known as A.C.E. and stands for Adventure, Character, Environment. The programme aims to develop character, inculcate values of grit and resilience and build leadership traits in all students as they learn adventure skills such as orienteering, rock climbing and abseiling as well as cultivate an appreciation for the outdoors and the environment during PE lessons and Level Camps. Students who excel at the various adventure skills may have the opportunity to participate at a higher challenge level in various outdoor competitions.

  
  
<u> General Criteria for All Talent Areas </u> <br>
1\.  Applicants should have a keen interest and passion for the respective talent areas. <br>
2\.  Applicants should have a positive learning attitude and a growth mindset. <br>
3\.  Applicants should have demonstrated good conduct and leadership skills in school.
