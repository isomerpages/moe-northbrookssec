<p>Officially opened on 20 October 2017, the Arts Space introduces an additional,
permanent feature that recognises the efforts to develop and cultivate
an&nbsp;arts&nbsp;appreciation amongst our students while at the same time,
flourish a vibrant culture of the arts in school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aimed at providing a proper and common space for students to showcase
artistic works, the Arts Space becomes a stepping stone for our students
who are exploring their potential at performing before venturing to perform
for a wider audience. The small and intimate setting is also an informal
gathering space for students to interact and express their creative talents
and interests after curriculum time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Situated next to the Music Room, the Arts Space is utilised by students
undergoing the General Music Programme (GMP).&nbsp;The Space&nbsp;transforms
into a hive of student activities during Music lessons as students rehearse
their presentations and simulate real stage performances.
<br>The Arts Space also supports the showcase of visual&nbsp;art works. During
the Post-Examination Activity (PEA) week recently,&nbsp;the Space&nbsp;was
one of the venues to host the annual Brooksian Art Exhibition entitled&nbsp;<strong><em>SOARTS</em></strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Arts Space certainly sees itself as one of the arenas in developing
and grooming potentials in the arts.</p>
