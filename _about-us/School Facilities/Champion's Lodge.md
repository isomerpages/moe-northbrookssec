<p>The Champions’ Lodge was officially launched in October 2017. It was designed
to provide a physical space for all Brooksians to unwind during after-school
hours. The design of the space such as the flooring, wall colour, layout
and choice of recreational activities was conceptualised by our very own
Brooksians. In addition, it is a platform whereby meaningful activities
and programmes such as workshops and games will be introduced to engage
students after school. The slogan of the space is ‘By Champions, For Champions’
which is the reason why the physical space is also a platform to develop
a culture of peer leadership among the students who have been tasked to
run the centre. This selected group of students were elected as an executive
committee and are in charge of running the lodge. For instance, the students
were also involved in the publicity and execution of the official launch
in October.</p>
<p>The student committee decided on the slogan ‘For Champions, by Champions’
and it guided them in deciding the type of activities that will take place
in the lodge. Presently, the room has a variety of activities that engage
students, such as a pool table, foosball tables, game consoles, board games,
dart board and a reading corner. In 2018, engaging and interesting workshops
will be introduced to all Brooksians. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 20th October 2017, School Advisory Committee Chairman, Mr. William
Choo, officially launched Champions’ Lodge. To create a fun-filled atmosphere,
the teachers and students designed several table games and activities such
as a lucky draw and a photo booth. In addition, representatives from the
student committee led members of the School Advisory Committee on a tour
of the physical space.</p>
<p>The Champions’ Lodge welcomes all Brooksians to visit the space and to
interact with fellow Brooksians through a variety of engaging activities
and interesting workshops.</p>
