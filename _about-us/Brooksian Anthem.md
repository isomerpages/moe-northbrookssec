Brooksian Anthem
================
With Brooksian fervour  
Lift up our voices  
Each day a new beginning  
Let hearts be open  
With hopes arising  
Our promise don’t deny. 

We’re friends who offer compassion  
Whatever the circumstance  
With fortitude we will overcome  
Be strong, be true, be free!

Reach for tomorrow  
Take hold our future  
Let’s build a brighter new day  
We’re soaring, yet rooted  
Take flight  
And see hopes and dreams come true  
Our fears to conquer  
Stand tall  
Discover who we are and more  
Making champions of us all  
Volatilis tamen radicalis  
O see our dreams come true  
Our fears to conquer  
Stand tall  
Discover who we are and more  
Making champions of us all  
Making champions of us all!
