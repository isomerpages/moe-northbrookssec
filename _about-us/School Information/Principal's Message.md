<p>A warm welcome to Northbrooks Secondary School!</p>
<p>I feel honoured and privileged to be the Principal of Northbrooks, carrying
forward the good work done by my predecessors.</p>
<p>Since its humble beginnings in 2000, Northbrooks Secondary has steadily
grown to become a choice school. Guided by our vision – Every Brooksian
a Champion, Impacting the Community – we are united in our desire to do
our very best for our students, preparing them to be effective life-long
learners. We foster in every Brooksian the Champion Learning Mindset, a
mindset with a strong desire to learn and improve and bounce back in the
face of adversities. We want to instil in our students this growth mindset,
developing grit and resilience that are essential for success in life.
In turn, our Brooksians will develop the capacity to serve by leading and
lead in serving our school, our community and our nation.</p>
<p>Here at Northbrooks, we have also progressively integrated Positive Education
(PosEd) concepts into our student development experiences, focusing on
well-being, self-care, and caring for one another. This demonstrates our
commitment to fostering a strong culture of care and growth in things that
we do. PosEd includes showing gratitude and appreciation, making time to
listen to others, and lending a helping hand to someone in need. Through
PosEd, our students learn to set larger goals, even beyond themselves.
This includes environmental sustainability, which is an area that we have
been focusing on through our Environmental Education programme since 2018.</p>
<p>I am excited by the opportunities for much learning and growth that await
us here at Northbrooks Secondary, and I am confident that our greatest
strength lies in our commitment to provide an all-rounded education for
our students.</p>
<p>While COVID-19 has presented us with many challenges, there are also exciting
opportunities and benefits to be reaped, particularly through the affordances
of technology. As we embrace the new normal and implement key MOE initiatives
in the coming years, such as the Personalised Digital Learning Programme
(PDLP) and Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB), I am certain that our whole
school community will forge ahead in this new chapter of life with confidence.</p>
<p>We remain steadfast in our beliefs and our conviction in making a positive
impact on our Brooksians. Together, our Brooksians will strive to do their
very best and stay rooted, serving to lead and leading to serve our community
and nation with humility.</p>
<p>Soaring Yet Rooted</p>
