<h3>WATER</h3>
<p>Just as water is the basis of life, the school both nurtures and challenges
Brooksians to learn and grow into Champions, impacting the community.</p>
<h3>TREES</h3>
<p>Just like trees such as Aspens and Giant Redwoods that support one another
with their strong roots intertwined, Brooksians are firmly connected with
one another and their loved ones. Just as Oaks hold one another up with
their deep roots during strong winds and violent storms, we seek to do
the same by building a strong foundation of moral values in our students
so that they have the moral courage to make the right choices in life when
they are pounded by the storms of life. The wide branches of the Oaks are
good nesting places that provide shelter for birds. Likewise, Northbrooks
provides a safe and nurturing environment for studenrts to develop their
talent and maximise their potential.</p>
<h3>GOLD Background</h3>
<p>Like gold, strong moral values provide Brooksians a solid foundation to
stand firm agaisnt the challenges of a rapidly changing world. With good
values, Brooksians become valuable individuals who impact the community
and the nation positively.</p>
