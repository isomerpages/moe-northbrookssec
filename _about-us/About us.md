Built at a cost of over S$23 million, the School is fully-equipped with IT facilities and is set amidst in the beautiful natural surroundings of Yishun Park.</p><p>The School is united in its desire to do its very best for its pupils and to prepare them for the future knowledge-based workplace. Besides developing their capacity to learn, the School will also focus on building the character of its pupils and helping them to develop compassion for others.</p><p>The name Northbrooks is derived from the Yuan Dynasty proverb yin shui si yuan. This is one of the core moral values inculcated in all Brooksians: to always remember their roots and to be grateful to their family, teachers, friends and country for the success they achieve in life.</p><h3>School Information</h3><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Principal:</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="2"><p>MR DAVID LAU YAN BOON</p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Vice Principal 1:<br>Vice Principal 2:<br>Vice Principal (Administration):</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="2"><p>MS GOH PEISHI<br>MR DANIEL YIP KOK HOONG<br>MR SAHRIL BIN YAHYA</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Type of School:</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="2"><p>GOVERNMENT SCHOOL/ MIXED SCHOOL/ SINGLE SESSION</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mother Tongue:</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="2"><p>CHINESE/ MALAY/ TAMIL</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" colspan="1"><p>Subjects Offered:<br><br></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>• ADDITIONAL MATHEMATICS,<br>• ART,<br>• BASIC CHINESE,<br>• BASIC MALAY,<br>• BIOLOGY,<br>• CHEMISTRY,<br>• CHINESE,<br>• CHINESE B,<br>• CHINESE N(A),<br>• CIVICS &amp; MORAL EDUCATION,<br>• COMBINED HUMANITIES (S,L),<br>• COMBINED HUMANITIES (S,G),<br>• COMBINED HUMANITIES (S,H),<br>• COMPUTER APPLICATIONS,<br>• DESIGN &amp; TECHNOLOGY,<br>• ELEMENTS OF BUSINESS SKILLS,<br>• ENGLISH LANGUAGE,<br>• ENGLISH LANGUAGE (SYLL A),<br>• ENGLISH LANGUAGE (SYLL T),<br><br></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>• NUTRITION &amp; FOOD SCIENCE,<br>• LITERATURE(E),<br>• MALAY,<br>• MALAY N(A),<br>• MATHEMATICS,<br>• MATHEMATICS (SYLLABUS A),<br>• MATHEMATICS (SYLLABUS T),<br>• MUSIC<br>• PHYSICS,<br>• SCIENCE,<br>• SCIENCE (PHY, CHEM),<br>• SCIENCE (CHEM, BIO),<br>• SCIENCE (PHY, BIO),<br>• SCIENCE (SYLL T),<br>• SOCIAL STUDIES,<br><br><br></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="2"><p>Note:<br>• The subjects below are offered to the current student cohort.
