About Us
========

The Beginning
-------------

Northbrooks Secondary School started at the dawn of a new millennium on 2 January 2000 with eight Secondary 1 classes. Built at a cost of over S$23 million, the School is fully-equipped with IT facilities and is set amidst in the beautiful natural surroundings of Yishun Park.

The School is united in its desire to do its very best for its pupils and to prepare them for the future knowledge-based workplace. Besides developing their capacity to learn, the School will also focus on building the character of its pupils and helping them to develop compassion for others.

The name Northbroks is derived from the Yuan Dynasty proverb yin shui si yuan. This is one of the core moral values inculcated in all Brooksians: to always remember their roots and to be grateful to their family, teachers, friends and country for the success they achieve in life.
