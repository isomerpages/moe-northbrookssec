### Core Focus

  
Performing Arts CCAs provide opportunities for students to develop a lifelong passion for the arts.

They are :  

1.  Appreciation – Students are involved in discussion and relating to the value of the respective art form and how this art form applies to their lives and societies across cultures.
2.  Creating – Students participate in activities to apply the art form skills, techniques and processes
3.  Presenting – Students will gain the opportunity to put to practice and showcase their skills in the art form.
4.  Responding – Students will learn to think critically and show confidence in their ability to reflect and express opinion on arts expression and performances.
