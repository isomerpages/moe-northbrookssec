CCE
===

In Northbrooks, we believe in developing Brooksian Champions with a growth mindset, grounded in G.I.F.T.E.D. values through Character and Citizenship Education (CCE). 

  

CCE is infused in all that we do at Northbrooks, and the design of our CCE curriculum takes reference from MOE’s CCE 2021 curriculum frame (see below), customized to the school’s context. Positive Education and the PERMA Theory of Well-Being also guides the CCE programme in Northbrooks.

#### The goals of CCE are:

*   Good character: Brooksians will have a sound moral compass, a strong sense of right and wrong, be caring towards others and strive for excellence.
*   Resilience and social-emotional well-being: Brooksians will have a balanced sense of self, be resilient when faced with challenges, find meaning in life, and have a sense of gratitude and appreciation.
*   Active citizenship: Brooksians will develop a sense of belonging to the nation, and the will to act on improving the lives of others and building a future for our nation
*   Future readiness: Brooksians will have a sense of purpose in life, and to develop the dispositions of adaptability and lifelong learning.

### CCE Curriculum content
----------------------

The CCE committee plans the CCE curriculum for the school and supports staff to ensure that CCE is carried out effectively in the classrooms.

  

The CCE curriculum content is based on the three big ideas of Identity, Relationships and Choices. It involves the learning of core values, social and emotional competencies, and citizenship dispositions, with a focus on developing a sense of purpose in our students. It includes the following: National Education, Sexuality Education, Mental Health, Education and Career Guidance, Cyber Wellness and Family Education.

  

The themes for the CCE lessons include the following:

*   Becoming My Best Self
*   Building Connections
*   Making Choices

  

### The Enactment of CCE
--------------------

A holistic approach to CCE involves explicit teaching, and reinforcement and application of learning. Multiple learning platforms are tapped on to help students internalize values, social-emotional competencies, and citizenship dispositions. These platforms include CCE lessons, key Student Development Experiences (SDEs) and school-based initiatives.

  

### A Caring and Enabling School Environment
----------------------------------------

For CCE to have a lasting impact on our students, the school and classroom environment need to support their learning. A caring and enabling environment has five key features that help students feel safe, accepted, empowered, and competent. We play a crucial role to establish and sustain these features, complementing them with a positive and proactive approach to discipline, and early support and intervention.
