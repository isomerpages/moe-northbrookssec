CCE
===

In Northbrooks, we believe in developing Brooksian Champions with a growth mindset, grounded in G.I.F.T.E.D. values through Character and Citizenship Education (CCE). 

  

CCE is infused in all that we do at Northbrooks, and the design of our CCE curriculum takes reference from MOE’s CCE 2021 curriculum frame (see below), customized to the school’s context. Positive Education and the PERMA Theory of Well-Being also guides the CCE programme in Northbrooks.
