<h1>Character and Citizenship Education</h1>
<p>In Northbrooks, we believe in developing Brooksian Champions with a growth
mindset, grounded in G.I.F.T.E.D. values through Character and Citizenship
Education (CCE).</p>
<p>CCE is infused in all that we do at Northbrooks, and the design of our
CCE curriculum takes reference from MOE’s CCE 2021 curriculum frame (see
below), customized to the school’s context. Positive Education and the
PERMA Theory of Well-Being also guides the CCE programme in Northbrooks.</p>

<h3>CCE Curriculum content</h3>
<hr>
<p>The CCE committee plans the CCE curriculum for the school and supports
staff to ensure that CCE is carried out effectively in the classrooms.</p>
<p>The CCE curriculum content is based on the three big ideas of Identity,
Relationships and Choices. It involves the learning of core values, social
and emotional competencies, and citizenship dispositions, with a focus
on developing a sense of purpose in our students. It includes the following:
National Education, Sexuality Education, Mental Health, Education and Career
Guidance, Cyber Wellness and Family Education.</p>
<p>The themes for the CCE lessons include the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Becoming My Best Self</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building Connections</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making Choices</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Enactment of CCE</h3>
<hr>
<p>A holistic approach to CCE involves explicit teaching, and reinforcement
and application of learning. Multiple learning platforms are tapped on
to help students internalize values, social-emotional competencies, and
citizenship dispositions. These platforms include CCE lessons, key Student
Development Experiences (SDEs) and school-based initiatives.</p>
<h3>A Caring and Enabling School Environment</h3>
<hr>
<p>For CCE to have a lasting impact on our students, the school and classroom
environment need to support their learning. A caring and enabling environment
has five key features that help students feel safe, accepted, empowered,
and competent. We play a crucial role to establish and sustain these features,
complementing them with a positive and proactive approach to discipline,
and early support and intervention.</p>
