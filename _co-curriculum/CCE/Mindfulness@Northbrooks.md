<p>Mindfulness can be described as the secular practice of paying attention
in the present moment, and doing it intentionally and with non-judgment.&nbsp;
Mindfulness practices also refer to the deliberate acts of regulating attention
through the observation of our thoughts, emotions and body states.</p>
<p>It is scientifically proven that practicing mindfulness reduces stress,
heightens our focus, improves physical and mental well- being and increases
our empathy, respect and resilience.&nbsp;In these trying times, these
are necessary qualities we need to acquire and it is imperative to stay
positive, calm and always be in the present moment. Letâ€™s live for the
moment and be grateful for what we have now.&nbsp;</p>
