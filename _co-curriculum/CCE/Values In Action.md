<h1>Values In Action</h1>
<p>The Values in Action (VIA) programme in Northbrooks is an integral part
of holistic education that every Brooksian receives. Values in Action (VIA)
is a Key Student Development Experience (SDE) that aims to nurture socially
responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through
the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. VIA is designed
to engender student ownership and initiative.</p>
<p>Under VIA, Brooksians are led by their CCE leaders to learn about community
issues and the needs of others, and come up with proposals on how they
can contribute to improvements in school, at home, or in the community.
Brooksians will reflect on their experience, the values they have put into
practice, and how they can continue to contribute meaningfully. The school
adopts the Design Thinking frameworkas part of the planning and implementation
of VIA projects.</p>
<p>Brooksians contribute to the society in various ways (see below):</p>
