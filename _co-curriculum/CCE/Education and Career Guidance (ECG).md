Education and Career Guidance (ECG)
===================================

Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is about equipping students with the necessary knowledge, skills, and values to make informed decisions at every key education stage for a successful transition from school to further education or work, so that they can manage their education and career pathways and practice lifelong learning throughout their lives.

### ECG aims to:

*   nurture student’s self-awareness and self-directedness for lifelong learning
*   enable students to explore education and career options, by equipping them with accurate and comprehensive information
*   help students develop a growth mindset and a resilient attitude to embrace future opportunities, and appreciate all occupations across society
*   create opportunities for students to build positive connections with the community (such as teachers, ECG counsellors, parents, industry partners), to develop an appreciation for different career pathways
