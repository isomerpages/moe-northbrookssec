Student Leadership Programme
============================

### Brooksian Leadership Framework
------------------------------

### Vision and Mission

In Northbrooks, we believe all students can be leaders. We define leadership as service – a service for a purpose that leads to a greater good. The act of leadership is influence – inspiring others to believe and act in for that purpose and hence the focus of leadership is people. The committee adopts a 3P tiered approach (1. Personal 2. Peer 3. People) towards leadership development for this limited timeframe when Brooksians passed through the gates of Northbrooks.
