<h3>Brooksian Leadership Framework</h3>
<hr>
<h3>Vision and Mission</h3>
<p>In Northbrooks, we believe all students can be leaders. We define leadership
as service – a service for a purpose that leads to a greater good. The
act of leadership is influence – inspiring others to believe and act in
for that purpose and hence the focus of leadership is people. The committee
adopts a 3P tiered approach (1. Personal 2. Peer 3. People) towards leadership
development for this limited timeframe when Brooksians passed through the
gates of Northbrooks.</p>
<h3>Tiered Approach</h3>
<p>This tiered approach is based on the sphere of influence of leadership
which believes that positive and influential leadership is to be built
upon strength in character so that greater good can be achieved. As such,
in Tier 1, the individual focuses on personal development in the acquisition
of the school’s GIFTED values and Self-Management in preparation for their
transit to higher levels of leadership beyond Northbrooks. In Tier 2, the
individual will have built a strong character foundation and possess leadership
potential. We define leadership potential as having traits such as hence
is able to acquire leadership skills to positively influence her peers.
In Tier 3, the individual is able to inspire and rally her community in
making a positive impact in the larger community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The leadership development curriculum, known as Brooksian Leadership model,
is designed based on the 3H (Heart, Head, and Hand) outcomes. The curriculum
aim to nurture student leaders who are anchored in the school’s GIFTED
values with the Heart to Serve (adapted from Servant Leadership by Robert
Greenleaf, 1977), possessed the Champion Mindset in their Heads, and empowered
with the 5 Practices of Exemplary Leadership (adapted from The Leadership
Challenge by Kouzes &amp; Posner, 1987) in their Hands. The Student Leadership
team believes that every student leader needs to be developed in the following
sequence:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Developing the heart to serve first&nbsp;
<br>Growing with a Growth Mindset of knowledge&nbsp;
<br>Equipping with the skillsets to serve&nbsp;</p>
<p>3P Tier Approach&nbsp;
<br>There is a need to tier student leaders into different categories so as
to track their developmental progress and to customise programmes at targeted
group of students. The tier-ing of Student Leaders takes close reference
to the leadership domain in LEAPS 2.0</p>

<h3>Professional Development for Teachers</h3>
<p>The Student Leadership team takes teacher training seriously and actively
role model continuous learning for our Student Leaders. The teachers have
undergone training workshops in experiential learning facilitation and
visual facilitation so as to cascade these skills to the Student Leaders.</p>
<p>The teachers are also kept abreast with the youth development scene in
Singapore through its learning journey to MOX, a collaborative entrepreneurship
company. During the visit, teachers caught a glimpse of synergistic possibilities
and how leadership is operationalised in local start-up firms.</p>
