#### Description

The Student Council consists of students leaders who have gone through a rigorous selection process using the schoolâ€™s Leadership Competency Index, interview and situational test. They are given training workshops and platforms to apply their skills and hone their competencies.  
  
The Student Council Executive Committee charts the direction of the events of the year under the guidance of the Council teachers. Their primary roles are to lift the school spirit and to be a voice for the student population.
