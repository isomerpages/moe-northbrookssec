Co-Curricular Activities Leaders
================================

### Description


The Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) leaders are selected by the CCA teachers after a monitoring period. These student leaders are given a variety of training platforms to hone their leadership competencies to cater to their specific CCA skillsets.  
  
The CCA leadersâ€™ teachers work synergistically with the CCA teachers to harness the creativity and potential of the student leaders to lead their CCAs well in providing a structured CCA experience for all students.
