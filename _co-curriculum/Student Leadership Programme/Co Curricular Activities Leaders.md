<p>Our Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) leaders are selected by the CCA teachers
after a monitoring period. These student leaders are given a variety of
training platforms to hone their leadership competencies to cater to their
specific CCA skillsets.</p>
<p>The CCA leaders’ teachers work synergistically with the CCA teachers to
harness the creativity and potential of the student leaders to lead their
CCAs well in providing a structured CCA experience for all students.</p>
