Co-Curricular Activities Leaders
================================

### Description


The Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) leaders are selected by the CCA teachers after a monitoring period. These student leaders are given a variety of training platforms to hone their leadership competencies to cater to their specific CCA skillsets.  
  
The CCA leaders’ teachers work synergistically with the CCA teachers to harness the creativity and potential of the student leaders to lead their CCAs well in providing a structured CCA experience for all students.
