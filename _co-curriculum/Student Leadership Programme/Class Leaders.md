Class Leaders
=============

#### Description

The class leaders are selected by form teachers to carry out their duties in the classroom to lead their classmates. They are trained internally by class leaders’ teachers of the Student Leadership Committee to work in tandem with the class committee to raise the class spirit and pride.

The class leaders undergo workshops to build class cohesion and develop conflict management skills. They also contribute to school-wide programmes such as helming the Parent-Teachers’ Conference sessions and Teachers’ Day.
