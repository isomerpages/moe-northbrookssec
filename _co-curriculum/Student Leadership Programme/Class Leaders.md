<p>Our class leaders are selected by form teachers to carry out their duties
in the classroom to lead their classmates. They are trained internally
by class leaders’ teachers of the Student Leadership Committee to work
in tandem with the class committee to raise the class spirit and pride.</p>
<p>The class leaders undergo workshops to build class cohesion and develop
conflict management skills. They also contribute to school-wide programmes
such as helming the Parent-Teachers’ Conference sessions and Teachers’
Day.</p>
