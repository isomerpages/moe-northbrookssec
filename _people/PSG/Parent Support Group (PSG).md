Dear Parents,   

##### “To share the responsibility and work in partnership with our school to develop our children’s potential.”

  

In line with this vision, we set the following objectives:
1.  **To play an active role in our programmes**
2.  **To establish a bridge between school management and faculty with parents.**
3.  **To provide appreciation and recognition for parents and school staff who are active and supportive in PSG activities/programmes**
We sincerely welcome you to join us as a member and if possible, volunteer a little of your time and expertise to help make the educational experience for our children better. Membership is free and all you need is to have a child who is a student at Northbrooks Secondary School.  

By being a PSG member, you will reap many benefits:  

*   Be kept informed of the latest development in Northbrooks Secondary School through our bi-monthly meetings and dialogue with the Principal and Vice Principals.
*   Have the opportunity to provide your feedback and share ideas – thereby contributing to change that will bring about positive growth and development of the school.
*   Attend workshops at no cost.
*   Your journey as a parent would be more fulfilling because:

*   You build your network of friends.
*   Your family participates in activities that will bring you closer together.

  

Jesse Jackson, American Civil Rights Activist, once said: “Your children need your presence more than your presents.” So come join us and let’s make a difference together!  

Yours sincerely,  

Mr Henry Ng  
HOD  
Internal Partners
