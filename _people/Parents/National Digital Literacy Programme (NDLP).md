#### Digital Learning @ Northbrooks

#### Activation of Device Management Application (DMA) Parent Portal
Dear Parent/Guardian, 

As communicated earlier, your child’s/ward’s Personal Learning Device (PLD) has been installed with a DMA to ensure that he/she uses the PLD for learning in a safer digital learning environment. The DMA Parent Portal will be made available from 1 November 2021 to allow you to monitor your child’s/ward’s PLD activities.

You will receive an activation e-mail via the e-mail address that you have provided to the school. If the activation e-mail is not found in your Inbox, please check the ‘Junk Folder’ or ‘Spam Folder’ for the e-mail notification.

Please refer to the DMA Parent Guide (under Resources) for details on how to set up your account and use to the Parent Portal.

Should you encounter technical issues with the DMA or wish to share with us any feedback on the DMA, please contact the DMA Administrator, Ms Salihah Binte Jalil at northbrooks_ict@moe.edu.sg.
