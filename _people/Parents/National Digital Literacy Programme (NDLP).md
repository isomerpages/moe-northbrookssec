Dear Parent/Guardian, 

As communicated earlier, your child’s/ward’s Personal Learning Device (PLD) has been installed with a DMA to ensure that he/she uses the PLD for learning in a safer digital learning environment. The DMA Parent Portal will be made available from 1 November 2021 to allow you to monitor your child’s/ward’s PLD activities.

You will receive an activation e-mail via the e-mail address that you have provided to the school. If the activation e-mail is not found in your Inbox, please check the ‘Junk Folder’ or ‘Spam Folder’ for the e-mail notification.
