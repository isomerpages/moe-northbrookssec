#### Section 1:  Welcome Message by Mr David Lau
------------------------------------------------------
Dear Parents and Sec One students (2022 intake),    

Thank you for choosing Northbrooks Secondary, and a very warm welcome to our Northbrooks Family.

In Northbrooks Secondary, we aim to inculcate in our students (Brooksians) the **Champion’s Learning Mindset** – one where there is a strong desire to learn and improve, and to bounce back in the face of adversities. Imbued with this growth mindset, we are confident that Brooksians will possess grit and resilience, with the “try-fail-try” spirit in all that they do. Our school motto, “**Soaring Yet Rooted**”, challenges Brooksians to SOAR to greater heights whilst staying ROOTED in values.

Our team of dedicated and caring staff will work alongside your child to provide the necessary support and guidance, to equip them with the skills and mindset to thrive in the new environment.

I wish everyone a wonderful and fulfilling year in 2022.

##### 3.  Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP)
![](/images/pdlp1.png)

At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed computing device or Personal Learning Device (PLD) by end-2021. 

Every Brooksian will be using the latest 8th generation Apple iPad (10.2”) as their personal learning device. Every iPad will come bundled with the pencil and keyboard to maximise the affordances of the iPad as a learning tool.  Lessons in the curriculum and co-curriculum will be designed intentionally to allow students to have the opportunity to apply their digital literacy, as we enable them to be future-ready in a digital world.

To reduce out-of-pocket cash from students, Singapore citizen students can use their Edusave account to pay for the PLD.  For students on financial assistance, further subsidies will be provided.  Currently, most students will be able to pay through their Edusave without paying any cash. The purchase process for 2022 sec 1 students will happen in Term 1, 2022.  More information will be provided in January 2022.

##### 4.  Blended Learning (BL)
![](/images/Blended%20Learning.png)


Blended Learning builds on Singapore’s education reform – “Learn for Life” movement – to build stronger abilities, skills and habits for independent and lifelong learning. This is in line with Northbrooks Mission to imbue in Brooksians a growth learning mindset, rooted in values and impacts the community, so as to better prepare the students for the future.

Blended Learning refers to the model of integrating Home-Based Learning (HBL) as a regular feature in the schooling experience. It constitutes a seamless learning experience, with days when students learn in school, and days (which could be termed as “Independent Learning Days”\*) when students can learn at home.

Through blended learning, we hope to nurture self-directed and independent learners and develop passionate and intrinsically motivated learners who possess the desire and passion to learn for life.
