### Welcome to the School Family Education Programme (SFE) 

### Background

*   School Family Education (SFE) is one of the recommendations of Family Matters! Singapore (FM!S) \[previously known as Public Education Committee on Family 9PEC)\].
    
*   SFE adopts a holistic family learning model - equipping parents with effective parenting skills and training them to be parent facilitators, helping school staff to enhance their family life, and providing students with life skills training.
