<p>Northbrooks Youth Flying Club (NYFC) was set up in January 2003 with the
aim of training and guiding pupils who were interested in pursuing a career
in the aerospace industry. During the earlier years, our students mastered
control-line flying, and took part and excelled in several National and
International Aeromodelling competitions. As we continue to develop our
Aerospace Niche, our Youth Flying Club currently pursues several platforms
- radio-controlled flying, drone flying, drone coding, FPV drone racing
and flight simulations. Over the years, our students have done well in
the Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition and other various inter-school
competitions like the National Airfix Aeromodelling Competition. We have
also incorporated the learning of airport ground operations and airport
engineering into the CCA curriculum. In close partnership with higher institutions,
the organisations from the aviation industry and Singapore Youth Flying
Club (SYFC), our club will continue to work towards greater heights.</p>
