<p><strong>Student’s Experience</strong>
</p>
<p>When I joined EAC back in 2018, I didn’t really like the idea of doing
art with recyclable materials initially. I felt like it was limiting what
I could do as an EAC member. However, I grew to like the medium eventually
and I like to challenge my creativity with these resources.</p>
<p>To me, EAC is a place where you can cultivate your talent in art and build
your foundation in creativity. It is also a nice and thoughtful to contribute
back to the community during our outreach sessions.</p>
<p>I grew better in my art and as a person in this CCA. I will like to thank
my CCA teachers for giving me the opportunity to try this new medium art
and a chance at making good memories.</p>

<p><strong>Student’s Experience</strong>
</p>
<p>Since the start of secondary 1, this CCA has been a fun and creative space
for me to express myself. It has been a positive experience for me as well
as in making great friends in this process.</p>
<p>EAC has given me the opportunity to improve my leadership skills and allowed
me to fine tune my stained glass cutting/ sharpening skills.</p>
<p>To me, EAC is full of talented people from many walks of life!</p>
