Dance as an art has a significant role to play in the holistic education in our schools. Even if a child can never carry his efforts far enough to realise dance in its highest forms, he should still be granted the chance to experience the joy of the rhythmic sense of free, controlled and expressive movement, and through this, be led to discover an important part of life.
