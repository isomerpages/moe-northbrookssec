### Objectives

*   To cultivate a deeper appreciation of the arts through music and movement (Graciousness)
*   To build confidence, discipline and learn to work well together towards a common goal (Fortitude, Teamwork, Empathy, Discipline)

  
Dance as an art has a significant role to play in the holistic education in our schools. Even if a child can never carry his efforts far enough to realise dance in its highest forms, he should still be granted the chance to experience the joy of the rhythmic sense of free, controlled and expressive movement, and through this, be led to discover an important part of life.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
Northbrooks Dance Explosion (DE) was formed in 2010. They are trained in modern, contemporary, hip hop and international dance styles. Since then, they had put up several internal and external performances.
