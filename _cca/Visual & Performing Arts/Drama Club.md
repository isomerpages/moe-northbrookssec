<p>Northbrooks’ Drama club is comprised of fun-loving, expressive and disciplined
teenagers who use their intellectual abilities to memorise scripts, and
their emotional capacity to empathise, in order to bring fictional characters
to life. By learning to control their bodies and to move with precision
in synchronicity with team members, the aesthetic ideal is approached.</p>
