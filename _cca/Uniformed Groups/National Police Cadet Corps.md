Student’s Experience

NPCC has guided me in many different ways and it has shaped me into becoming who I am today. The trainings every week were tiring, but it taught me to persevere on and endure through my 4 years. Despite all these tough trainings, I was still able to have fun, by hanging out with the seniors and making friends with other units during area events.
