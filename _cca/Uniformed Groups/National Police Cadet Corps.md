<b>Student’s Experience</b> <br>
NPCC has guided me in many different ways and it has shaped me into becoming who I am today. The trainings every week were tiring, but it taught me to persevere on and endure through my 4 years. Despite all these tough trainings, I was still able to have fun, by hanging out with the seniors and making friends with other units during area events.

SSGT(NPCC) Darwin Azhar Bin Azni

"Without NPCC, I would have never been able to change my ways during my third year in secondary school. After my second year, I realised that my attitude and behaviour in school at that point of time would not bring me any good. Things changed after I went through the Cadet Leader Training Course in secondary three. My personality changed for the better and I matured. Thanks to NPCC, my life became better than before. I have become the leader who I have always wanted to be - driven and disciplined one."
