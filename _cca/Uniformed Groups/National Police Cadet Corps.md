<br><strong>Student Class (Class / Year):</strong>&nbsp;4F 2018
<br><strong>Student role in CCA:</strong>&nbsp;Chairperson&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Student’s Experience</strong> 
<br>NPCC has guided me in many different ways and it has shaped me into becoming
who I am today. The trainings every week were tiring, but it taught me
to persevere on and endure through my 4 years. Despite all these tough
trainings, I was still able to have fun, by hanging out with the seniors
and making friends with other units during area events.</p>
