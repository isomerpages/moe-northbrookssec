Uniformed Groups
================

### Core Focus

The Uniformed Groups (UG) are recognised as a strong character building platform, as it helps to instil in students commitment and loyalty to the nation, develop ruggedness of body and mind as well as cultivate leadership qualities and discipline and esprit de corps. It is important that a significant proportion of our students continue to benefit from the UG.

<b>Our Vision</b>  

UG, The Preferred Choice

<b>Our Mission</b>  

We build and enhance the capacity of schools and stakeholders to enrich studentsâ€™ experience through the Uniformed Groups.
