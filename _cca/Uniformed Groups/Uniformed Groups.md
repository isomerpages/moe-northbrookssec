<h1>Uniformed Groups</h1>
<h3>Core Focus</h3>
<p>The Uniformed Groups (UG) are recognised as a strong character building
platform, as it helps to instil in students commitment and loyalty to the
nation, develop ruggedness of body and mind as well as cultivate leadership
qualities and discipline and esprit de corps. It is important that a significant
proportion of our students continue to benefit from the UG.</p>
<p><strong>Our Vision</strong>
</p>
<p>UG, The Preferred Choice</p>
<p><strong>Our Mission</strong>
</p>
<p>We build and enhance the capacity of schools and stakeholders to enrich
studentsâ€™ experience through the Uniformed Groups.</p>
