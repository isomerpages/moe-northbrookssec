<h3>Training Day / Time</h3>
<p>Wednesdays, 3.00pm - 6.00pm</p>
<p>Northbrooks Secondary School NCC (Air) unit aims to develop disciplined
and responsible cadets who possess strong leadership qualities and values
such as integrity, teamwork and fortitude. This is done through various
activities such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>foot drills,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individual Field Craft,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>orienteering,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wings programme,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>aeromodelling programme,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use of the SAR-21 assault rifle, and&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Total Defence programme.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The training in Secondary 1 begins with the learning of basic foot drills,
which is important to teach cadets discipline and teamwork. Secondary 1
cadets are exposed to adventure training through Camp FORGE. During the
camp, cadets will try out the Motivation Obstacle Course, rappelling, archery,
and Flying Fox. Cadets will learn to fold and launch paper aeroplanes as
part of the aeromodelling programme.</p>
<p>These help to build character, instill confidence and develop the adventure
spirit in cadets.</p>
<p>In Secondary 2, cadets will learn intermediate foot drills and elements
of Individual Field Craft. Secondary 2 cadets will attend Camp STEEL to
build on their character, confidence and adventure spirit through the High
Confidence Challenge Course, Rappelling, and Paintball Shooting. They will
also be taught and assessed on the technical handling of SAR-21 assault
rifles. Cadets will learn to construct and launch balsa wood gliders as
part of the modeling programme.</p>
<p>Secondary 3 cadets are assessed on the skills learnt in lower secondary
during Specialist Assessment. Selected cadets will undergo leadership training
and be groomed to take on advanced leadership roles such as the Unit Sergeant
Major and Assistant Unit Sergeant Major by attending the Senior Specialist
Leaders Course. NCC (Air) provides a learning platform for students to
acquire essential leadership skills and a spirit of adventure to help them
face their future challenges. Cadets will learn to operate quadcopters
(drones) as part of the aeromodelling programme.</p>
<p>The physical fitness of cadets is developed with regular physical training
sessions. These trainings are made enjoyable with the occasional introduction
of games such as soccer and Captainâ€™s Ball.</p>
