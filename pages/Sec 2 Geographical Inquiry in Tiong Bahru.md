Sec 2 Geographical Inquiry in Tiong Bahru
=========================================

#### On 5 January 2017

The Secondary 2 Express and Normal (Academic) students conducted their Geographical Investigation in the Tiong Bahru area in March 2016. Their inquiry question was, "What Makes Tiong Bahru Special to its Residents?" They interviewed residents at Tiong Bahru Market to collect real data that they used to draw their conclusions later. They also practised other geographical skills such as sketching the changing housing landscape of the area, as well as conducting a land-use survey. These tasks helped students to understand the changing resident profile in the area.

Apart from the opportunity to apply their geographical skills, students were required to perform online research of the history and heritage of Tiong Bahru. They were able to identify the unique architecture of the flats built by the Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) after the war, along with the various murals depicting interesting features of Tiong Bahru. This helped to create a more visual experience.Â 

In their post-activity reflections, students revealed that the experience had taught them to appreciate older neighbourhoods that contain a rich history and heritage.
