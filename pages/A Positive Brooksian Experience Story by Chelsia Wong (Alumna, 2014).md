“Stereotypes do not define who I am.”  

When asked for a quote for the A\*STAR Scholarship Ceremony 2018, I gave it much thought before I finally submitted this quote. Elitism is a very real issue that not many people discuss, and I chose this quote as I wanted to prove that you do not have to come from a branded school to succeed.

I studied in Northbrooks Secondary School from 2011 to 2014.  Upon graduating from Northbrooks, I enrolled into my dream course of Perfumery and Cosmetics Science in Singapore Polytechnic (SP) via Direct Polytechnic Admission (DPA), currently known as Early Admission Exercise (EAE).  It was thanks to a career guidance lesson in Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), now known as Education and Career Guidance (ECG), in Secondary 2 when I found out about this course.  Why did I choose this course?  As a 14-year-old girl, I was getting interested in make-up and skincare.  In addition, Secondary 2 was streaming year, and I knew I wanted to be in the pure sciences class in upper secondary. Hence, the course, Diploma in Perfumery and Cosmetic Science (DPCS), was perfect for me.

While studying in SP, I found that my passion lay in core and theoretical Chemistry, rather than its applications in perfumery and cosmetics.  Hence, I decided to serve a 10-month long internship at the Institute of Chemical and Engineering Sciences (ICES) in A\*STAR.  During my internship, I was tasked with an independent project to encapsulate an anti-acne active ingredient using biodegradable block copolymers via an ICES patented technology.  This further strengthened my passion in Science and research.  Therefore, I applied for the prestigious A\*STAR Undergraduate Scholarship and was very thankful to be awarded it successfully.

Many of my teachers in Northbrooks have shaped me to what I am today.  To name a few, my Science teachers, Mr Sim Yong Ming and Ms Low Ai Jiao, have impacted me the most.

I still remember Mr Sim’s topical Science lessons very vividly.  From lessons about Newton’s First Law to Waves, he really sparked my interest in Science and Physics.  Furthermore, he was the Teacher-In-Charge of the Executive Committee of the Student Council during my term.  I learnt a lot about the process of planning and executing school-level events.  While serving as the Secretary of the Student Council in 2013, I led the school in morning assemblies every week.  In addition, I represented my CCA, Red Cross Youth to command the school in the assemblies, as I was also the Vice-Chairperson (Operations) of the unit.

Ms Low was my Form Teacher in Secondary 2 and Chemistry teacher in upper secondary. My love for the subject grew exponentially while I was under her care. It was also Ms Low who helped me discover the courses offered in the various polytechnics.  I believe that without her support, I would not be where I am today.

**I still remember a story told by my Secondary 1 Form Teacher, Ms Lee Yin Jern (who is not with Northbrooks anymore).  It is about how the most beautiful lotus flowers bloom from the murkiest of waters.  I would like to believe that although we have our fair share of murky waters, the time does come to blossom into the most beautiful lotus flowers we can all be.**
