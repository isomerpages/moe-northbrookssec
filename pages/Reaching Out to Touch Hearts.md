Reaching Out to Touch Hearts
============================

“At the old folks’ home, it was sad to see the elderly folks without their families and we realised that they were not as privileged as us. Therefore, we were happy to put a smile on their faces.” – Putri Nur ‘Aqiilah and Razvin Kaur Rachel (4 Discipline of 2018)

“We assisted in the preparation of food for soup which is donated to the needy at Willing Hearts Organisation.  Although preparing food was certainly no easy task, we were glad that we had the opportunity to help the needy.” – Camden Nah and Hadri Haqimi (4 Fortitude of 2018)    
  
 We cherish our students who live out Northbrooks’ Vision: ‘Every Brooksian a Champion, Impacting the Community’.    
  
 How do we nurture Brooksians into active citizens, grounded in our school values of Graciousness, Integrity, Fortitude, Empathy and Discipline? In part, through our numerous Values–in-Action (VIA) Service Learning programmes.    
  
Presently, our VIA programme is conducted over 2 years. At Secondary 2, students learn the fundamentals of service learning. Following this, students with a strong desire to serve the community undergo a leadership training programme at Secondary 3, which empowers them to lead their classes on their service learning projects. Equipped with facilitation and communication skills, they brainstorm on possible projects and liaise with beneficiaries on behalf of their classes.

Moving forward, the VIA programme will be expanded to involve all levels by 2019.  Secondary 1 students will be exposed to basic project management skills, including budgeting and proposal writing, which complement the Secondary 2 programme. While the graduating cohort will get a chance to apply all they have learnt through the years, by advocating for a cause they feel passionately for.    
  
Working hand in hand with our community partners, especially the organisations Northbrooks has worked closely with over the years and the beneficiaries whom our students liaise with for Service Learning, Brooksians are Champions who impact the community, both actively and positively.
