Danny from 1G, Asfa from 1T and Zikri from 1D took part in the Paper Glider Range as well as Paper Glider Longest Time Aloft Challenge. Ammar from 2G took part in the Quadcopter Drone Radio Control Flight Challenge while Bryan from 2E took part in the Balsa Wood Glider - Catapult Launched Glider Challenge. They had to think critically and consider the various aspects of glider mechanics before constructing their respective gliders. This was a great platform for them to apply what they have learned during their training sessions in school.<br><br>It was a tough competition for the boys but we are pleased to announce that Bryan clinched the 3rd place in the competition! He constructed the glider within 1.5 hours, based on the schematics provided that morning before successfully launching it.<br><br><img src="https://northbrookssec.moe.edu.sg/qql/slot/u162/Achievements/CCA%20Achievements/2018-2019%20CCA%20Achievements/Danny%20folding%2001.JPG" alt="Danny folding 01.JPG" width="364" height="264"><img src="https://northbrookssec.moe.edu.sg/qql/slot/u162/Achievements/CCA%20Achievements/2018-2019%20CCA%20Achievements/Bryan%20assembling%2001.JPG" alt="Bryan assembling 01.JPG" width="377" height="283"><br><img src="https://northbrookssec.moe.edu.sg/qql/slot/u162/Achievements/CCA%20Achievements/2018-2019%20CCA%20Achievements/Zikri%20launch%2001.JPG" alt="Zikri launch 01.JPG" width="374" height="280"><img src="https://northbrookssec.moe.edu.sg/qql/slot/u162/Achievements/CCA%20Achievements/2018-2019%20CCA%20Achievements/Bryan%20receiving%20medal%2002.JPG" alt="Bryan receiving medal 02.JPG" width="367" height="247"><br><img src="https://northbrookssec.moe.edu.sg/qql/slot/u162/Achievements/CCA%20Achievements/2018-2019%20CCA%20Achievements/CCAAchievement_NPCC.jpg" alt="CCAAchievement_NPCC.jpg" width="400" height="225"><br>                              </td>
