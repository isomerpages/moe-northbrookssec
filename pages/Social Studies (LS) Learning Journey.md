Social Studies (LS) Learning Journey
====================================

Social Studies (LS) Learning Journey- The World War II Tours
------------------------------------------------------------

The Humanities department organised a Social Studies Learning Journey for the Lower Secondary (NT) classes in alignment with the WWII theme, which was included in the Social Studies syllabus. The Sec 1 pupils went on the Battlefield Tour where they visited the Reflections at Bukit Chandu and Labrador Park. The Sec 2 pupils went on Exploring Changi in World War II where they visited the Changi Museum, Johore Monster Gun Battery and the Sook Ching Operation site at the Changi Beach. The pupils were accompanied by Ms Salihah, Mr Hafez, Mr Alex Tok and Mdm Nuraida.

Through this Learning Journey, the pupils experienced the multi-sensorial approach in learning Social Studies. They saw artefacts and places which enhanced their content knowledge and understanding of not only the topic on WWII, but also on the importance of defending our homeland. The sacrifices and perseverance of the war heroes and victims had shown that We Ourselves Must Defend Singapore and we all have a part to play.
