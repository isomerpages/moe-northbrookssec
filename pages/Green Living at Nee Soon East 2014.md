# Green Living at Nee Soon East 2014
###### On 4 September 2014
Northbrooks Interact Green Club members participated in the yearly Nee Soon East Green Living event, graced by MP Mr Patrick Tay. Interactors created a variety of funfair games using recycled materials, entertaining the residents who participated in the event. The wall mural was painted by Interactors who volunteered their time over a span of two weeks.
