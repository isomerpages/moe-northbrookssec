#### On 5 January 2017

The Secondary 1 and 2 Normal (Technical) students visited the Battle Box at Fort Canning Hill to learn about the key events leading up to Singapore's fall during the Second World War. Students learnt about the key strategic issues that led to Singapore’s surrender on 15th February 1942.   

  

The underground bunker setting provided an authentic learning experience for students as they journeyed through the corridors of a key installation during Singapore's darkest period. During the tour, students were captivated by the interesting stories, and also came up close and personal with historical artifacts. 

The experience was both immersive and enriching as it allowed students to develop a greater appreciation for Singapore's historical background.
