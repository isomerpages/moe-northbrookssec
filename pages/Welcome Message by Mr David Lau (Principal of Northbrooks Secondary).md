#### Section 1:  Welcome Message by Mr David Lau
------------------------------------------------------
Dear Parents and Sec One students (2022 intake),    

Thank you for choosing Northbrooks Secondary, and a very warm welcome to our Northbrooks Family.

In Northbrooks Secondary, we aim to inculcate in our students (Brooksians) the **Champion’s Learning Mindset** – one where there is a strong desire to learn and improve, and to bounce back in the face of adversities. Imbued with this growth mindset, we are confident that Brooksians will possess grit and resilience, with the “try-fail-try” spirit in all that they do. Our school motto, “**Soaring Yet Rooted**”, challenges Brooksians to SOAR to greater heights whilst staying ROOTED in values.

Our team of dedicated and caring staff will work alongside your child to provide the necessary support and guidance, to equip them with the skills and mindset to thrive in the new environment.

I wish everyone a wonderful and fulfilling year in 2022.
