On 14th March 2016, the Secondary 4 Express and Normal (Academic) Geography students visited Chinatown. Our objective was to allow our students to conduct a Geographical Investigation on Global Tourism in Chinatown. In order for our students to achieve this, they had to work in small groups to conduct interviews, map the land use through data collection with a land use survey of the streets, and carry out tourism perception surveys to understand the impact of Chinatown on Singapore’s tourism sector.
