Geography Rocks!
================

The Sec 1 pupils had their hands on the rocks during their Geography lessons. They had to identify the various characteristics and make a comparative study on the rock samples. Each rock has its own character and uses. Working in groups, they had to answer a set of guiding questions that help them in their own investigation and discussions.
