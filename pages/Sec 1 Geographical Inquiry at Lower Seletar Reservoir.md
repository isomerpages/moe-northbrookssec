=====================================================

#### On 5 January 2017

  

On 24th and 25th August 2016, the Secondary One Express and Normal (Academic) students embarked on their geographical inquiry at Lower Seletar Reservoir. Their goal was to discover the importance of Lower Seletar Reservoir located at Yishun Avenue 1 as one of the sources of water in Singapore.

As part of their Geography curriculum dealt with the importance of Singapore’s water supply, our students were introduced to the Public Utilities Board’s “Active, Beautiful and Clean Waters (ABC Waters)” programme, the 2-hour water trail created an awareness and appreciation of Singapore’s reservoirs and waterways as well as its care, protection and management.

  

The highlight of the trail was a hands-on experience in water testing. Using simple tools, students collected some samples of water and recorded their observations on the quality of water from the reservoir.
