Northbrooks: A Sustainable Campus.
==================================

"It's essential that we learn how to take care of our environment and Northbrooks has taught us just that." - Charmaine Chan Shi Ning (4 Fortitude of 2018).     
  
Northbrooks Secondary walks the walk in loving our planet, by providing green-education learning spaces all around the school.    
  
We welcome you to step into our thriving herb garden, where visitors can try their hand at caring for the plants, as well as learn about our local flora.    
  
“I hope that through teaching our students how to tend to a garden, I can impart some of my passion to them.” -  Mr. Poon Soon Hong (our school gardener)

As we seek partnerships from sponsors and experts in urban landscaping, we will have transformed our existing garden into a green learning space within the next five years.  What’s more, we now have two food waste convertors which can turn food waste from the canteen into fertilizer for our herb garden. In the process, students learn that their individual actions matter. They witness how their efforts to reduce the amount of food thrown away, can also beautify the school environment.    
  
 You can’t miss our green wall of plants at the entrance of the school’s foyer.  Not only does it have an uplifting and calming effect on Brooksians as they come into the school; it also purifies the air and reduces noise and heat.  Did you know that it was partially constructed out of recyclable material?    
  
 We plan to use our school as a test bed for teaching Brooksians about energy efficiency technologies, such as replacing our existing air-conditioners with alternative cooling systems that consume less energy.    
  
 Through these initiatives, we are growing Champions who care deeply about the impact our actions can have on our planet and the climate.
