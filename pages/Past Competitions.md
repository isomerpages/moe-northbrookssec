### Singapore GeoSpatial Challenge 2013
-----------------------------------

  
Four of our Sec 3 students - Jasmine Lin, Jew Sok Fang, Tan Yoke Peng and Eunice Angelica - competed against other schools in the Singapore GeoSpatial Challenge organised by the Singapore Land Authority on 24 July 2013. It is a scavenger hunt game that makes use of the GPS-enabled smartphones to plan, strategise and locate geocaches around Fort Canning.  Although the competition was tough, the students had a fun-filled educational experience learning to use Geographic Information System (GIS) technology to collect data and plan strategies, monitor their progress and compete with other teams.  With much fortitude and tenacity, the students managed to complete their tasks and were awarded certificates of participation for their effort.

### Senoko Sustainability Challenge 2013
------------------------------------

  
Northbrooks sent in two teams to participate in the Senoko Sustainability challenge 2013. In this challenge, the teams had to propose a hypothesis related to climate and the environment.  They had to collect and analyse data, write a report and present their findings to a team of judges who visited the school.  The two teams spent many afternoons from March to May working on their projects.  

Team One, BusyBees, consisted of Jasmine Lin, Eunice Angelica, Jew Sok Fang and Kung Hak Yee from Sec 3 NA worked with Ms Foong and did a study on the eco-friendly practices of 120 people of different age groups and gender.  For their effort, they were awarded Certificates of Commendation. 

Team Two, consisted of Johnson Wong, Bryan Ho, Ryan Waters and Li Hao from Sec 3 Express, worked with Mdm Nuraida to test out assumptions and hypotheses on the microclimatic conditions at the different levels of the classroom blocks.  The information they gathered and analysed helped them to understand the warm temperatures they experienced in the classrooms.  They received Certificates of Participation.  The challenge was a learning experience for the students who were able to develop their thinking, analysis and presentation skills.
