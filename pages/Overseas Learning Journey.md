The objectives of this trip were to inculcate in our students a passion for the Humanities subjects through an authentic learning experience. We wanted to provide opportunities for students to live out the school values of Graciousness, Teamwork, and Discipline, by learning and working together, and interacting with people from a different culture. We also wanted to broaden our students’ horizons through learning for life from the larger community beyond their school.

The 3 days/2 nights trip covered cultural activities in Johor and Malacca town, Malaysia. The students visited local farms, and plantations (rubber and oil palm). They even visited Kampung Seri Wangi where they learnt Kuih Bahulu-making without the use of an oven, and played traditional games such as Congkak and Top-Spinning (gasing). They also learnt to weave coconut leaves with their hands, a skill used by many cottage industry sellers to make ketupat, or even mats. En route to Malacca, the group stopped at Sarang Buaya to have a closer look at how coffee beans and pineapples are grown. We also visited a cottage industry that makes a local product known as Gula Melaka.

  

The activities in Malacca included visits to heritage places such as the Portugese Settlement, Cheng Ho Museum, Jewelry Straits Chinese Museum, Harmony Street,  Porta de Santiago (A’Famosa), St. Paul’s Church, Victoria Fountain, the Watermill, the Christchurch, and The Stadthuys. The students attended a Baba and Nyonya Wedding Show at the restaurant where they had dinner. It ended with our students learning from the performers and participating on stage with them. The final cultural visits were to the Chitty Village–commonly known as the Peranakan Indians—to better understand the culture and lifestyle of the Chittys, and Kampung Morten, a conserved Malay village.
