“Brooksians Score ACE!”
=======================

The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.    
  
 Brooksians take that step together in the Outdoor Education journey through their level camps as part of the school’s Outdoor Education Lifelong Learning Programme (OE-LLP), known as the A.C.E. Programme which encompasses Adventure Skills, Building Character and Caring for the Environment.    
  
 ●    Adventure Skills: Road cycling, trail cycling, kayaking 1-star course and orienteering.  
 ●    Character: Building empathy through community walk and developing resilience through the Pulau Ubin cycling expedition  
 ●    Environment: Learning about water conservation efforts and cleaning up Singapore’s waterways while paddling on kayaks.

 In Tier 1, students gain broad exposure to all the A.C.E. elements. The camps are planned to introduce progressive levels of challenge from Secondary One to Three.  Lower secondary camps are held locally to focus on increasing students’ awareness of the Yishun community we are part of. At Secondary Three, they head to a campsite in Malaysia for an overseas experience.

 “It’s interesting to see another side of my Form Teachers! We forged stronger bonds when they kayaked alongside us to help clean up the reservoir. We also harvested sweet potatoes together at the campsite in Malaysia.” - Castillo Justine (3 Graciousness).    
  
 In the Tier 2 programme, selected students undergo further training in specific outdoor skills, in order to participate in the Greendale Adventure Race organised by Greendale Secondary School annually since 2015 and where Northbrooks have been placed in the top 5 positions.

In the most recent 2018 race, participating student teams navigated around the Punggol area looking for checkpoints. At these various checkpoints, they showcased their skills in areas like knot-tying, first aid bandaging and cycling.    
  
 Crowned Champions, beating 30 participating teams, Estela Astrid (4 Integrity), the Captain of the mixed team exclaimed, “We were determined to complete every checkpoint on the course.  It’s truly satisfying to emerge as Champions!”
