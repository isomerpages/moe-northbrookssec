Multi-disciplinary Water Learning Programme
===========================================

When you take the train between Khatib and Yio Chu Kang MRT stations, you will look out at the beautiful waters and pleasant greenery at Lower Seletar Reservoir Park.    
  
 It’s also one of our classrooms.?    
  
 Imagine the difference it makes, when students visit this park to learn about the importance of Singapore’s water catchment areas, rather than read about it in textbooks. They can see the expanse of water, take water samples, and listen to the sounds of nature at Lower Seletar Reservoir.

 “I got to test water for the first time. I got to shake the test tube like a scientist.” -  Balqis Humaira (1 Teamwork of 2018)    
  
 “I learned the importance of clean water. If our reservoirs are polluted, how can we survive?" - Koh Yue Yao (2 Empathy of 2018)    
  
 Since 2014, our Water Learning Programme, conducted by the Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) department, has provideds students with an authentic learning experience. During the Learning Journey (LJ) to Lower Seletar Reservoir, students have the opportunity to apply vocabulary taught in class and practice their language skills. The Public Utilities Board was so impressed with our teaching resources Water Learning Activity Booklet that it has since adapted them to produce materials to support other schools.    
  
 Recognising that meaningful connections across various subjects deepen learning, we leveraged ICT and adopted a multidisciplinary approach to the programme in 2018. Now, students apply the knowledge and skills learned in their classroom lessons:  
  
 (a)   **Geography:**  Carry out Geographical Investigation techniques on water testing and form conclusion on the water quality,  
 (b)   **Science:**  Comprehend the function of rain garden and bio retention swales as natural features to clean water; and  
 (c)   **Mathematics:**  Apply Mathematics knowledge to answer question based on a sample utility bill that every household receives every month.

 In addition, this LJ also provides opportunities for Brooksians to hone their speaking and leadership skills when they, in turn, conduct tours of the reservoir for primary school students. In 2017, our Water Ambassadors led a tour in Chinese for Primary 4 – 6 students from Yishun Primary School. This year, the programme has expanded and is offered to all the N6 Cluster primary schools in both Chinese and Malay.
