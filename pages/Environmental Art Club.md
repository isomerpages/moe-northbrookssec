**Student’s Experience**

When I joined EAC back in 2018, I didn’t really like the idea of doing art with recyclable materials initially. I felt like it was limiting what I could do as an EAC member. However, I grew to like the medium eventually and I like to challenge my creativity with these resources.

To me, EAC is a place where you can cultivate your talent in art and build your foundation in creativity. It is also a nice and thoughtful to contribute back to the community during our outreach sessions.

I grew better in my art and as a person in this CCA. I will like to thank my CCA teachers for giving me the opportunity to try this new medium art and a chance at making good memories.

**Student’s Experience**

Since the start of secondary 1, this CCA has been a fun and creative space for me to express myself. It has been a positive experience for me as well as in making great friends in this process.

EAC has given me the opportunity to improve my leadership skills and allowed me to fine tune my stained glass cutting/ sharpening skills.

To me, EAC is full of talented people from many walks of life!
