Interactive Heritage Trail
==========================

#### On 5 January 2017

On 18th and 19th May 2016, the Secondary Two Express and Normal (Academic) students participated in the interactive heritage trail to Fort Canning. They were there to learn more about the contributions of Singapore’s early local and immigrant communities. These contributions had a great impact on Singapore’s political independence, and social and cultural developments; they were integral to developing strong political and social institutions for nationhood and citizenship.

Our students used mobile devices to perform tasks to better understand the relevance of Fort Canning to Singapore’s history. They were required to answer quiz questions, take videos of themselves, and perform various other tasks as a group. In their reflections, students praised this trail for allowing them to gain a greater understanding of how Singapore defended itself against the Japanese attacks. The necessity of having to defend their own country was, thus, impressed upon them. This need to defend ourselves has shaped the socio-cultural, political climate of Singapore.
