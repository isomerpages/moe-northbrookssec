##### On 30 November 2015

Northbrooks Secondary School has been awarded the Aviation in Schools Initiative Award (AIS) by Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) for developing long-term plans to involve students and teachers in aviation.

This award is in recognition of the efforts taken to build a niche in Aerospace and an environment where students are constantly exposed to aviation for enrichment and career guidance. The school has also worked closely with CAAS to expose our students to aerospace not just in terms of curriculum, but also through learning journeys, workshops, enrichment programmes and other activities.
