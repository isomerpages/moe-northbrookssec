<h5>On 30 November 2015</h5>
<p>Northbrooks Secondary School has been awarded the Aviation in Schools
Initiative Award (AIS) by Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS)
for developing long-term plans to involve students and teachers in aviation.</p>
<p>This award is in recognition of the efforts taken to build a niche in
Aerospace and an environment where students are constantly exposed to aviation
for enrichment and career guidance. The school has also worked closely
with CAAS to expose our students to aerospace not just in terms of curriculum,
but also through learning journeys, workshops, enrichment programmes and
other activities.</p>

<p>In October 2014, Lower Secondary students learned how to make recycled
flowers from plastic bags in a Values-In-Action project entitled ‘Tribute

were presented to our non-teaching and cleaning staff to show our appreciation

several artworks created by our students for an Art community outreach
project in collaboration with Asiamalls Management Pte Ltd. The students
were invited to paint on A2-sized canvases, to illustrate what the national
spirit means to them. Artworks by Brooksians are among the 184 beautiful
art pieces on display in the impressive three-dimensional art installation,
hung from the skylight in the atrium of Hougang Mall. The massive art installation
was aimed at creating for shoppers a unique experience in which they would
be able to enjoy and appreciate artwork by students. The exhibits will
