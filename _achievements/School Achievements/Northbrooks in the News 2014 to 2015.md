##### On 30 November 2015

Northbrooks Secondary School has been awarded the Aviation in Schools Initiative Award (AIS) by Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) for developing long-term plans to involve students and teachers in aviation.

This award is in recognition of the efforts taken to build a niche in Aerospace and an environment where students are constantly exposed to aviation for enrichment and career guidance. The school has also worked closely with CAAS to expose our students to aerospace not just in terms of curriculum, but also through learning journeys, workshops, enrichment programmes and other activities.

##### On 19 October 2015

Northbrooks Secondary School has been active in championing green efforts to educate our students on the 3Rs through learning experiences and programmes.  
  
Here are some of the noteworthy highlights of the year.

In October 2014, Lower Secondary students learned how to make recycled flowers from plastic bags in a Values-In-Action project entitled ‘Tribute to Our Unsung Heroes’. These carnation bouquets and some handwritten messages were presented to our non-teaching and cleaning staff to show our appreciation towards them.

The Secondary 2 students designed games booths from recycled materials as part of their post-examination activities in May 2015. Students were invited to try out the games to win prizes.  
  
These efforts have been recognised at the SEC-Starhub School Green Awards (SGA) and 3R Awards this year, with Northbrooks being awarded the <b>Lotus Sustained Achievement Award</b> and the <b>Gold Award</b> respectively!

During the <b>N6 Cluster Sports Fiesta</b> that was held on 28th August, Northbrooks sent two teams of students and one team of teachers to compete in the Ultimate Frisbee competition.  
  

One team of students emerged  <b>CHAMPIONS</b> and the other team of students came in <b>6th out of 10</b>! Our students were truly gracious champions as they also cheered for other schools when they were playing the game. Their team spirit, fortitude in competition and graciousness certainly embodied the school values and Champion mindset that we aspire for our students to achieve.

The staff team came in 4th out of 7 teams.
