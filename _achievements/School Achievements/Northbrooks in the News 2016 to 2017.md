It was their first time they had ever written a Science report and designed a Science poster, but two teams of 1G students gamely rolled up their sleeves and spent months planning and then presenting their work at the 16th Elementz Science Project Competition and Exhibition held in Anderson Secondary School on 24th and 26th July.   

  

With a total of 46 lower secondary teams from schools in the North Zone participating in the competition, our two teams managed to achieve a Bronze and a Certificate of Commendation.   

The objectives of this competition were to: <br>
(a) generate interest in scientific study through investigative-type projects in science, and; <br>
(b) provide a platform for schools in the North Zone to exhibit and share their findings   

  

In addition to planning and conducting scientific experiments, each group was required to write a 1000-word report to describe their project and findings, and to design posters to highlight the gist of their experimental purposes, approaches and conclusions. The competition ended with students’ oral presentations to the judges as well as Q&A sessions on 24th July. On 26th July, their project booths were open to all North Zone schools for viewing and voting for the Viewer's Choice Award.   

  

The students have displayed high levels of enthusiasm and scientific inquiry throughout the project. In fact, all of them have even expressed great interest to join the competition again next year.   Our Brooksian Champions who took part in this festival were:

The <b>Finals</b> of the <b>National Story Challenge 2016</b> was held on Saturday, 12 March, and the team from Northbrooks was placed <u><b>Second in the Grand Finals</b></u>!

  

The competition requires teams of 3 student participants to create and dramatise an original story. Teams are given 15 minutes to prepare and enact their story based on a given topic (e.g. 'The Midnight Train'), and in the last 3 minutes, are given a condition which is unique to their team (e.g. 'There must be 3 rabbits in the story', or 'One of the characters must say "I'm pretty!" three times'). They are to then dramatise a 3-  to 4-minute story in front of judges. 

  

The students attended 3 drama workshops to help prepare them for the competition. 

Despite the challenging nature of the competition, the students demonstrated mental resilience, spontaneity, creativity, teamwork and an impressive amount of confidence.
