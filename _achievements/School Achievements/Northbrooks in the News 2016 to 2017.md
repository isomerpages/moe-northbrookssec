<p>It was their first time they had ever written a Science report and designed
a Science poster, but two teams of 1G students gamely rolled up their sleeves
and spent months planning and then presenting their work at the 16th&nbsp;Elementz&nbsp;Science
Project Competition and Exhibition held in Anderson Secondary School on
24th&nbsp;and 26th&nbsp;July. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a total of&nbsp;46 lower secondary teams from&nbsp;schools in the
North Zone participating&nbsp;in the competition, our two teams managed
to achieve a Bronze and a Certificate of Commendation. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The objectives of this competition were to:
<br>(a) generate interest in scientific study through investigative-type projects
in science, and;
<br>(b)&nbsp;provide a platform for schools in the North Zone to exhibit and
share their findings &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to planning and conducting scientific experiments,&nbsp;each
group was&nbsp;required to write&nbsp;a&nbsp;1000-word report to describe
their project and&nbsp;findings, and to design posters to highlight the
gist of their experimental purposes, approaches and conclusions. The competition
ended with students’ oral presentations to the judges as well as Q&amp;A
sessions on 24th&nbsp;July. On 26th&nbsp;July, their project booths were
open to all North Zone schools for viewing and voting for the Viewer's
Choice Award. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The students have displayed high levels of enthusiasm and scientific inquiry
throughout the project. In fact, all of them have even expressed great
interest to join the competition again next year. &nbsp; Our Brooksian
Champions who took part in this festival were:</p>
