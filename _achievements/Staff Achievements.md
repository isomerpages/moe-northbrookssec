<b>Congratulations and Well Done Mr Sanjay!</b>


<img src="/images/Sanjay%20Coach%20Medallion%202.jpg" style="width:250px;height:200px;margin-left:15px;" align = "right">

Northbrooks congratulates Mr Sanjay Radakrishna, who was awarded the Singapore Coach Medallion at the third CoachSG conference. He was among the 10 recipients for the award and one of only two teacher-coaches.  

Fuelled by his passion and dedication to inculcate the love of sports with the next generation, Mr Sanjay assembled a team of students to form an athletics interest group. When the team was first assembled four years ago, Northbrooks finished 28th in the Schools National cross-country competition. In 2019, they broke into the top 10 for the first time. 

We are proud of Mr Sanjay’s achievements and we’d like to thank him for being an exceptional role model and going the extra mile for his students.
