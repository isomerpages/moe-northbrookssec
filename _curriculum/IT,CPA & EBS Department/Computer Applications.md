Computer Applications
=====================

### Aims of Syllabus
----------------

 The Computer Applications syllabus aims to prepare students to be technologically adept citizens, and to function and contribute effectively in an increasingly technologically-driven world. The syllabus emphasises fundamental knowledge and skills, and includes the appreciation and use of several software application packages for word processing, computer drawing and image editing, multimedia presentations and documents, spreadsheet calculations and charts, game design, programming; as well as, applications on the Internet.

Specifically, the aims of the syllabus are to enable students to:

1.  acquire skills in using a variety of application software and associated computer hardware to accomplish tasks, communicate, and facilitate activities
2.  develop an awareness of how computing technology is used in the home, school, workplace and community
3.  appreciate the role computers play in everyday life and recognise the impact computers have on society and people
4.  develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

    <td class="tg-hoi2"><span style="color:#000">This module introduces students to information communication technology and equips them with a basic knowledge of computing and communication devices. There is emphasis on fundamental computing knowledge and skills, and the impact of technology on people and society. Current developments in hardware and software are included where applicable. Computer usage and applications covered will range from the use of a desktop computer to internet technologies, and will include topics on computer ethics and security.</span></td>

    <td class="tg-9jjg">MODULE 2<br> <br>MEDIA ELEMENTS (MEL)</td>
    <td class="tg-auud"><span style="color:#000">This module introduces students to design and drawing with computer software. The basic concepts, tools and techniques for creating and manipulating 2D vector graphics are covered. Students will edit and work with bitmap graphics and learn the difference between vector and bitmap graphics. Students will learn that vector graphics (drawings in 2D) are the foundation for 3D graphics and animation. They will be introduced to the concept of frames and frame rate when they engage in creating and editing video/movie clips. Students will also learn how to create and edit sound/voice clips for different purposes.</span></td>

    <td class="tg-1z39">MODULE 3<br> <br>DOCUMENT PROCESSING (DOP)</td>
    <td class="tg-hoi2"><span style="color:#000">This module introduces students to the design of visually effective documents through the combined use of text and graphics. Students will learn page layout, page and text format, as well as work with data in tables and mail merge. Students will also learn to embed chart (with or without data table) from spreadsheet application software into word document, as well as use auto shapes for drawing flowcharts.</span></td>

  <tr>
    <td class="tg-9jjg">MODULE 4<br> <br>SPREADSHEETS (SST)</td>
    <td class="tg-auud"><span style="color:#000">This module introduces students to the use of spreadsheets to solve problems in real-life situations and flowcharts to represent the algorithms. Students will use the spreadsheet for required calculations; and understand the use of formulas, functions and cell referencing. Students will also learn to format cells, perform what-if analysis, sort data and develop an appreciation of the use of spreadsheets in everyday decision-making. Students will learn to express problem solutions using statements, flowcharts, formulas, functions, and mathematical and conditional expressions. They will learn to apply data formatting, understand the need for data validation, check for error conditions, and run and test the solutions on a computer.</span></td>

    <td class="tg-1z39">MODULE 5<br> <br>MULTIMEDIA COMMUNICATION (MMC)</td>
    <td class="tg-hoi2"><span style="color:#000">This module introduces students to the use of application software for multimedia presentations and documents. Students will learn to communicate messages, information and ideas effectively. They will also learn to use information responsibly. Students will learn that multimedia presentations and documents may incorporate the different media elements: text, graphics, sound, animation and video. Students will recognise the importance of storyboarding, learn and apply the principles of interface design as they engage in creating multimedia documents for presentations and for publishing on the Internet.</span></td>

  <tr>
    <td class="tg-9jjg">MODULE 6<br> <br>MEDIA COMPUTING (MEC)</td>
    <td class="tg-auud"><span style="color:#000">This module introduces students to a scripting software, which has drag-and-drop program elements in a mouse-based editor that prohibits syntax errors. Students are taught programming and problem solving through the activity of storytelling, using English-like statements, short instructions, and flowcharts. Students will learn how media elements such as text, graphics and sound may be combined into an entertaining multimedia animated story or game. The animation allows students to see the state of the program, and provides an easy-to-see relationship between the program construct and the animated action.   </span></td>
