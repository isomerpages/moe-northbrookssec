Science Department
==================

The Science Department aspires to empower all Brooksians to become Champions who nurture a passion for learning, develop strong moral values and a keen sense of duty and community through the learning of Science.

### Passion for Learning
--------------------

Students’ engagement in learning science is developed through various modes and strategies such as hands-on activities, experiential lessons, learning journeys, projects and competitions.  Inquiry-based learning (IBL) is one such pedagogy that allows students to develop important science skills and processes.

### Strong Moral Values and Keen Sense of Duty and Community
--------------------------------------------------------

Learning of science is made authentic and science concepts are linked to real-life situations and examples. Students also learn how the responsible and ethical application of science and technology can be used to improve our lives and our community.
