learning journeys, projects and competitions.&nbsp; Inquiry-based learning

skills and processes.</p>
<h3>Strong Moral Values and Keen Sense of Duty and Community</h3>

<p>Learning of science is made authentic and science concepts are linked
to&nbsp;real-life&nbsp;situations and examples. Students also learn how
the responsible and ethical application of science and technology can be
used to improve our lives and our community.</p>
