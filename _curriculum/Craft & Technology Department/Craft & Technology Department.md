### **Signature C&T Programmes and Activities**
**Secondary One Visual Art-Stained Glass**  


Brooksians are introduced to the art of Stained Glass making. They will learn the basic principles of designing and making a Stained Glass piece as part of their Visual Art class.  As an art form, it provides an authentic platform for nurturing Habits of Mind. They will work in teams to develop fortitude and resilience and learn to value each other’s strengths. Based on a theme-specified, students exercise their creativity to develop intricate stained glass art pieces.

**Lower Secondary FCE Projects**

Brooksians participate in their Lower Secondary FCE Projects which are an essential part of the FCE curriculum to deepen their process and research skills to become independent, creative and critical learners. They are tasked with themes related to the school’s ALP (Aerospace) and LLP (Outdoor Education) where they will be taught to make informed decisions with appropriate justifications to select suitable ingredients to complete the task. They will apply food preparation techniques and the appropriate cooking method in the preparation of their food task.

**Upper Secondary D&T Auto-CAD Workshop**

Brooksians taking D&T as an elective at the GCE 'N' and 'O' Level Examinations are introduced to this hands-on Computer-Aided design (CAD) software workshop which takes them on a journey beginning with drafting the most basic elements of a drawing through completing a small project. Along the way, they will gain an understanding of the application as a complete design tool for design communication. This workshop provides them with a CAD application to initiate and complete their D&T exam projects independently.

**External Competitions and Learning Journeys**

Brooksians are exposed to a wide range of experiential opportunities where they can to become independent, creative and critical learners. These platforms enrich their learning and enable them to acquire knowledge beyond textbooks and a better understanding of the C&T curriculum. These opportunities also serve as platforms for them to pursue their passions and cultivate a deeper interest in C&T subjects.

**Annual Art & Design Exhibition**

Brooksians participate in our annual Art & Design exhibition held at the end of the school year to celebrate their outstanding achievements in Art and D&T works to instill a sense of pride and to encourage the appreciation of art in Brooksians.
