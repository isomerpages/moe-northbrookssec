Visual Arts Unit
================

The Visual Arts Unit in Northbrooks Secondary School aims to enable every Brooksian to be **visually literate** and to **appreciate art**. Brooksians studying Visual Art will be equipped with skills to communicate their ideas by creating visuals using different art forms and mediums to see the value and relevance of art in their lives.
