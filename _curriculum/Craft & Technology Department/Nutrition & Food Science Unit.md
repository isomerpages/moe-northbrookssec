<p>The school’s Personal Learning Device Program (PLDP) present new opportunities
for NFS teachers to engage with the students. It allows for the use of
technology in FCE programmes which has immensely increased students’ engagement
with the subject content. FCE Games such as the Escape room allow students
to collaborate with one another in order to solve FCE-related puzzles and
exploration of the Culinary Food Laboratory to provide a learning experience
that is immersive and engaging. Students also use their devices to capture
high resolution pictures on their finished products in order to capture
their learning.</p>
