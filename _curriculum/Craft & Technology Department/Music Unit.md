<h1>Music Unit</h1>
<p>Music soothes the soul and makes a child whole! In our General Music Programme
(GMP), we aim to develop students’ musical skills through listening, creating
and performing music. We also aim for students to realise and stretch their
musical potential and capabilities through our weekly music lessons.</p>
