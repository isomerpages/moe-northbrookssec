The Physical Education (PE) department oversees the delivery of lessons in physical health &amp; fitness, sports and games as well as Outdoor Education. The Northbrooks PE curriculum is designed in relation to our subjectâ€™s national syllabus and policies such as 21CC and Singapore Teaching Practice (STP). We envision every Brooksian to be a physically active individual who leads a healthy lifestyle. In addition, it is our hope that every Brooksian graduate will possess values of sportsmanship and resilience to impact the community.

### Physical Education Framework
----------------------------
*   Brooksians will undergo quality PE lessons to hone their decision-making in games and build confidence and values of sportsmanship in intra-class games
*   Brooksians will be able to apply their skills learnt during PE lessons in Inter-Class Games and build class spirit and camaraderie&nbsp;
*   Brooksians will be prepared in outdoor skills and apply them in the level camps in outdoor settings
*   Brooksians who desire a higher level of challenge will be afforded opportunities to embark on expeditions and competitions to test their skills at the highest level

### Signature PE Programmes and Activities
--------------------------------------

  

##### Cross Country

Brooksians participate in our annual Cross Country race in the outdoor setting of MacRitchie reservoir. Students train regularly during the PE lessons in school and at Yishun Park to be ready for this exciting event. This event offers exposure to an authentic outdoor setting and also promotes the appreciation of our environment in this nature reserve. The classes often cheer and encourage their peers to build class and school spirit during this event.&nbsp;

  

##### Level Camps

Brooksians participate in their Level Camps from Secondary 1 to 3 across a variety of locations. They engage in activities such as Kayaking, Cycling and Trekking with a focus on character building and care for the environment. In Sec 1, the students are based mainly on the school campus. For Sec 2s they are exposed to a local campsite. For Sec 3s, they are brought to Pulau Ubin or any overseas campsite to experience outdoors in a novel setting.

  

##### Sport Education Programmes

Brooksians are introduced to several new sports under the SEP such as Bowling, Archery and Inline skating. The objective is to allow students to be exposed to sports which are beyond the PE Curriculum. This is to enrich their overall school experience and also trigger potential interest in students to pursue the sport in greater depth beyond school.

  

##### Post Exam Activities

Brooksians are often exposed to the activity of Orienteering during Post-Exam Activities period. They are brought to many parks around Singapore, such as Sembawang, Bishan and Jurong Lake Park to experience navigating in those new settings.&nbsp;

  

##### Inter-Class Games

Brooksians participate in our annual Inter-Class games as a summative experience to apply the skills that they have honed during the PE lessons. This allows students to experience at least 4 inter-class competitions during their time with Northbrooks. The objectives of the ICG include application of skills, developing class spirit and comraderies through cheering.

  

##### External Competitions and Learning Journeys

Brooksians who desire a higher level of challenge in several outdoor adventure skills are given the opportunity to go for external learning journeys and expeditions such as trekking, kayaking and cycling expeditions. Students who are identified to be competent in Orienteering are also afforded the chance to represent the school and country in overseas competitions such as the Asian Junior Youth Orienteering Championships.
