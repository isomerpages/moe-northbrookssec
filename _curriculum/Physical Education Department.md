<h3>Physical Education Department Philosophy</h3>
<p>The Physical Education (PE) department oversees the delivery of lessons
in physical health and fitness, sports and games as well as Outdoor Education.
The Northbrooks PE curriculum is designed in relation to our subject’s
national syllabus and policies such as 21st Century Competencies and the
Singapore Teaching Practice (STP). We envision every Brooksian to be a
physically active individual who leads a healthy lifestyle. In addition,
it is our hope that every Brooksian graduate will possess values of sportsmanship
and resilience to impact the community.</p>

<h3>Signature PE Programmes and Activities</h3>
<h4>Cross Country</h4>
<p>Our Brooksians participate annually in a Cross Country race held in outdoor
settings such as MacRitchie or Bedok Reservoir. Prior to the event, they
receive regular training during their PE lessons in school and at Yishun
Park to ready themselves for the exciting event. This event offers exposure
to an authentic outdoor setting and promotes an appreciation of the natural
environment. Students frequently engage in enthusiastic cheering and offer
encouragement to their classmates, fostering a keen sense of camaraderie
and school pride throughout this event.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Level Camps&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Our Brooksians participate in their Level Camps from Secondary One to
Three across a variety of locations. Through activities such as Kayaking,
Cycling and Trekking, our student learns to care for the environment and
develop positive character traits. In Secondary One, our Brooksians participate
in activities based in and around the school’s campus. In Secondary Two,
they are exposed to activities held at a local campsite. In Secondary Three,
they embark on an outdoor adventure camp at Pulau Ubin or an overseas campsite
to experience outdoors in a novel setting.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Sport Education Programmes&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Brooksians are introduced to several new sports beyond the PE Curriculum
under the Sports Education Programmes (SEPs) such as Bowling, Archery,
and Inline Skating. The SEPs help enrich their overall school experience
and trigger potential interest in students to pursue the sport in greater
depth beyond school.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Post Exam Activities&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Brooksians are exposed to the activity of Orienteering during the Post-Exam
period. They are brought to the parks around Singapore, such as Sembawang,
Bishan and Jurong Lake Park to experience navigating in those new settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Inter-Class Games&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Brooksians participate annually in our Inter-Class Games (ICG) to apply
the skills they have honed during their PE lessons. This allows students
to experience at least 4 inter-class competitions during their time with
Northbrooks. The objectives of the ICG include application of skills, developing
class spirit and comraderies through cheering.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>External Competitions and Learning Journeys&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Brooksians who desire greater challenge in outdoor adventure skills are
given the opportunity to go for external learning journeys and expeditions
such as trekking, kayaking and cycling expeditions. Students who are identified
to be competent in Orienteering are also afforded the chance to represent
the school and country in overseas competitions such as the Asian Junior
Youth Orienteering Championships.</p>
