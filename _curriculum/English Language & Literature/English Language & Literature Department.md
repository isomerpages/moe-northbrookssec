<h3>English Language Curriculum</h3>
<h4>Objectives / Outcomes</h4>
<p>By the end of the 4-5 years of secondary school education at Northbrooks,
a Brooksian should be able to develop competencies to become:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>empathetic communicators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>discerning readers, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>creative inquirers</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Approach / Pedagogy</h4>
<p>In line with the school’s strategic plan to foster critical thinking through
active learning (SO 1.1), the English Department designs curriculum with
a focus on the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Inquiry through Dialogue</strong>&nbsp;- Students deepen their
learning of language through exploratory talk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Metacognition</strong>&nbsp;- Students use metacognition strategies
to guide their processing of information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multiliteracies</strong>&nbsp;- Students become aware of and adept
at analysing the multi-modal nature of texts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The school’s strategic objective to enhance assessment for learning (AfL)
through effective feedback is carried out through the department’s use
of ‘Responsive Teaching, Responsive Assessment’ to guide our practices.
Teachers also adopt the thoughtful and flexible use of CLLIPS and ACoLADE
through the CLEAR framework, as laid out in the EL Syllabus.</p>
