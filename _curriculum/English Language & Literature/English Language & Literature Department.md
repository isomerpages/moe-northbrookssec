English Language Department
===========================

### English Language Curriculum

  

#### Objectives / Outcomes

  
By the end of the 4-5 years of secondary school education at Northbrooks, a Brooksian should be able to develop competencies to become:

1.  empathetic communicators
2.  discerning readers, and
3.  creative inquirers

  

#### Approach / Pedagogy



In line with the school’s strategic plan to foster critical thinking through active learning (SO 1.1), the English Department designs curriculum with a focus on the following:  

*   **Inquiry through Dialogue** \- Students deepen their learning of language through exploratory talk.
*   **Metacognition** \- Students use metacognition strategies to guide their processing of information.
*   **Multiliteracies** \- Students become aware of and adept at analysing the multi-modal nature of texts.

The school’s strategic objective to enhance assessment for learning (AfL) through effective feedback (SO 1.2) is carried out through the department’s use of ‘Responsive Teaching, Responsive Assessment’ to guide our practices. Teachers also adopt the thoughtful and flexible use of CLLIPS and ACoLADE through the CLEAR framework, as laid out in the EL Syllabus.
