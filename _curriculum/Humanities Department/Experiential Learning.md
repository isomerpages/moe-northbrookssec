<h3>Secondary Two Geographical Investigation</h3>
<hr>
<h6>On 5 July 2016</h6>
<p>The Secondary 2 Express and Normal Academic students conducted their Geographical
Investigation (GI) in the Tiong Bahru area in March. They were investigating
"What Made Tiong Bahru Special to Its Residents?". They interviewed residents
at Tiong Bahru Market to collect first-hand real data. They also practised
other Geographical skills such as sketching the changing housing landscape
of the area as well as conducting a land use survey. These tasks helped
students to understand the changing resident profile in this area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apart from the opportunity to apply the Geographical skills learnt, students
were required to carry out prior online research of the history and heritage
of Tiong Bahru. They were able to identify the unique architecture of the
flats built by Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) after the war and the
various murals depicting interesting features of Tiong Bahru. This helped
to create a more visual experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In their post-GI reflection, students reflected that the experience has
taught them to appreciate older neighbourhoods which contain a rich history
and heritage.</p>

<h3>Sec 1 and 2 NT Learning Journey to Battlebox</h3>
<hr>
<h6>On 27 June 2016</h6>
<p>The Secondary 1 and 2 (Normal Technical) students visited the Battle Box
at Fort Canning Hill to learn about the key events leading up to Singapore's
fall during the Second World War. Students learnt about the key strategic
issues that led to Singaporeâ€™s surrender on 15 February 1942.</p>
<p>The underground bunker setting provided an authentic learning experience
for students as they journeyed through the corridors of a key installation
during Singapore's darkest period in history. During the tour, students
were captivated by the interesting stories and also came up close and personal
with historical artefacts.</p>
<p>The experience was both immersive and enriching as it allowed students
to develop a greater appreciation for Singapore's historical background.</p>
