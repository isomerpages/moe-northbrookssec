 On 27 February 2016, a team of 3 Brooksians, Amanda Ong (3I), Paula Mendez (3G) and Wang Sishi (3G) participated in the NUS Geo Challenge organised by the NUS Geography Society. It was an insightful experience to meet and interact with students from other schools, the members of the NUS Geography Society and invited speakers.
 
###  N6 Cluster Humanities Challenge
----------------------------

###### On 28th June 2016

The N6 Cluster Humanities Challenge was held at Presbyterian High School. Northbrooks Secondary School entered three teams to participate in the challenge and we are proud to announce that two of our teams made it to the finals. Eventually, one of them emerged 2nd Runner-up!  

  

This year’s Humanities Challenge was based on the United Nations’ theme for 2016: ‘Year of Pulses’. The Humanities Challenge addressed various national and international issues on food resources from past to present. In this challenge, the different teams underwent two rounds of competition. In the first round, students had to answer a total of 25 multiple-choice questions. And in the second round, they had to answer 10 short-answer questions. Student supporters also participated in a round of online questions during the tea break. 

This was an opportunity to arouse the interest in the Humanities and also encourage exploration in the various concepts related to Food Resources.
