<p>&nbsp;On 27 February 2016, a team of 3 Brooksians, Amanda Ong (3I),&nbsp;Paula
Mendez (3G) and Wang&nbsp;Sishi&nbsp;(3G) participated in the NUS Geo Challenge
organised by the NUS Geography Society. It was an insightful experience
to meet and interact with students from other schools, the members of the
NUS Geography Society and invited speakers.</p>
<h3>N6 Cluster Humanities Challenge</h3>
<hr>
<h6>On 28th June 2016</h6>
<p>The N6 Cluster Humanities Challenge was held at Presbyterian High School.
Northbrooks Secondary School entered three teams to participate in the
challenge and we are proud to announce that two of our teams made it to
the finals. Eventually, one of them emerged 2nd Runner-up!</p>
<p>This year’s Humanities Challenge was based on the United Nations’ theme
for 2016: ‘Year of Pulses’. The Humanities Challenge addressed various
national and international issues on food resources from past to present.
In this challenge, the different teams underwent two rounds of competition.
In the first round, students had to answer a total of 25 multiple-choice
questions. And in the second round, they had to answer 10 short-answer
questions. Student supporters also participated in a round of online questions
during the tea break.</p>
<p>This was an opportunity to arouse the interest in the Humanities and also
encourage exploration in the various concepts related to Food Resources.</p>
