<p>The Mathematics department inspires the love for Mathematics through the
Department Pedagogy, Concept-Rich Instruction (CRI) by Meir Ben-Hur.&nbsp;
In CRI, teachers first identify the core concepts of the mathematics curriculum
and plan an instructional sequence that builds upon concepts students already
understand and gradually engages students in further learning.&nbsp; Teachers
design learning experiences that provoke thoughtful discussions which lead
to new mathematical concepts and prepare students to apply these concepts
on their own.&nbsp; In short, the department emphasises the importance
of&nbsp;<strong>learning experiences</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>applications of mathematics</strong>&nbsp;in
enthusing the students in the learning of the subject.</p>
