The Mathematics department inspires the love for Mathematics through the Department Pedagogy, Concept-Rich Instruction (CRI) by Meir Ben-Hur.  In CRI, teachers first identify the core concepts of the mathematics curriculum and plan an instructional sequence that builds upon concepts students already understand and gradually engages students in further learning.  Teachers design learning experiences that provoke thoughtful discussions which lead to new mathematical concepts and prepare students to apply these concepts on their own.  In short, the department emphasises the importance of **learning experiences** and **applications of mathematics** in enthusing the students in the learning of the subject.
