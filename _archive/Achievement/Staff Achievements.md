<p>The OYEA is a national award that recognises and honours the achievements
of young educators who have a passion and commitment to teaching, inspiring
and nurturing their students. Launched in 1999, it seeks to recognise excellent
younger teachers for their youthful idealism, enthusiasm, energy and active
involvement in the development of youth beyond the formal curriculum.</p>

<p>Northbrooks congratulates Mr Sanjay Radakrishna, who was awarded the Singapore
Coach Medallion at the third CoachSG conference. He was among the 10 recipients
for the award and one of only two teacher-coaches.</p>
<p>Fuelled by his passion and dedication to inculcate the love of sports
with the next generation, Mr Sanjay assembled a team of students to form
an athletics interest group. When the team was first assembled four years
ago, Northbrooks finished 28th in the Schools National cross-country competition.
In 2019, they broke into the top 10 for the first time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are proud of Mr Sanjay’s achievements and we’d like to thank him for
being an exceptional role model and going the extra mile for his students.
