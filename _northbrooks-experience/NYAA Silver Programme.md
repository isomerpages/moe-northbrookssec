<p>Below are the descriptions of the activities for each section planned
for our students:
<br><em><u>Service Learning (Touching Lives, Making a Difference)</u></em> 
<br>Values in Action – Secondary 3 Service Learning</p>
<p>The Service Learning programme for Secondary 3 students provides students
with the opportunity to work with a beneficiary of their choice. While
teachers act as facilitators, the programme is essentially student-centred
with the planning, implementation and evaluation all done by the students.
This programme which spans over 3 terms (January to September) allows Brooksians
to develop their social and cross-cultural skills when they work with various
beneficiary organisations (the young, senior citizens, the underprivileged
or the environment). The planning and organisation of the Service Learning
activities also helps to hone the leadership skills among the Secondary
3 students and also inculcates in them a sense of responsibility. A series
of reflective activities has also been built into this programme to help
build their critical thinking skills as well as develop their SEL competencies.</p>

<p>The National Youth Achievement Award (NYAA) Youth Leadership Development
Programme is an exciting self-development programme for young people between
the ages of 13 and 30 years old. It is a holistic, balanced and non-competitive
programme of voluntary leisure time activities, designed to provide our
young people with a platform to develop personal qualities and skills to
make a difference to themselves, their communities and the world. The new
NYAA programme is designed in line with the Ministry of Education’s Levels
of Attainment, focusing on effort and merit of the individual.</p>
<p>To qualify for the Award, participants are required to complete a balanced
programme of non-competitive activities grouped under&nbsp;<strong><u>three sections</u></strong>:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;<strong><u>Service Learning</u></strong>&nbsp;<strong>(Touching Lives, Making a Difference)</strong>
<br>This component recognizes young people’s development as socially responsible
citizens who understand the issues faced by the community and explore how
they can contribute actively to find a solution. They can choose to undertake
a Values-In-Action project or any community service projects of their interest.</p>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong>
<br>To learn how to give useful service to others in the community and to
understand the meaning behind voluntary service.
<br><strong>Conditions:</strong>
<br>Bronze: At least 20 hours of regular activities spread over a minimum
period of 4 months.
<br>Silver: At least 40 hours of regular activities spread over a minimum
period of 8 months.
<br>Gold: At least 60 hours of regular activities spread over a minimum period
of 12 months.</p>
<p>2.<strong><u> Outdoor Appreciation</u></strong>&nbsp;<strong>(To be at Ease with Nature)</strong>
<br>Outdoor learning supports the development of confidence building as young
people are placed in unfamiliar environments outside of the classroom.
It also develops young people’s problem-solving skills, enhances teamwork,
strengthens understanding of the natural environment and inculcates in
young people a sense of stewardship for our environment.
<br><strong>Objective:</strong>
<br>To be at ease with nature and develop stewardship for our environment.
<br><strong>Conditions:</strong>
<br>Bronze: At least 15 hours of outdoor activities with a specific learning
goal.

of other activities. Explorations must take the form of a journey and involve
some hours of traveling time.</p>
<p>3.<strong><u>Healthy Living</u></strong>&nbsp;<strong>(Physical &amp; Mental Wellness)</strong>
<br>Healthy living aims to develop and maintain a healthy lifestyle that allows
us to get through our daily activities. It also hopes to develop a healthy
body and mind. Our behavior has a significant impact on our wellness and
adapting healthy habits with a balanced diet and exercise while avoiding
destructive habits such as tobacco, drugs and alcohol will improve both
our physical and emotional well-being.
<br><strong>Objective:</strong>
<br>To develop physical and mental wellness through healthy living
<br><strong>Conditions:</strong> 
<br>Bronze: At least 24 hours of regular activities spread over a period of
6 months.
<br>Silver: At least 32 hours of regular activities spread over a period of

<br><strong>For Gold Level Only</strong> 
<br>For the NYAA Gold Level, participants are required to undertake the fourth
component:</p>
<p>4.<strong><u>Community Leadership Initiative</u></strong>&nbsp;<strong>(Creating an Impact, Delivering Change)</strong>
<br>This component challenges participants to take on leadership roles in
their own community service projects. Participants are to identify a need
in our community and through the understanding of cultural differences,
find solutions to contribute effectively to bring about a positive outcome.
Participants will have the opportunity to showcase their leadership skills
as they work in partnership with people from various backgrounds to undertake
a community project that will not only broaden their horizons but also
trains them into culturally sensitive, service-oriented and holistic leaders.
The newly remodelled section hopes to see more student/youth-initiated
activities that bring positive and meaningful contributions to the community,
be it on the national or international level.
<br><strong>Objective:</strong>
<br>To build leadership skills while serving the needs of the community.
<br><strong>Conditions:</strong> 
<br>The Gold Level participant can embark on the initiative individually or
in small groups.</p>
<p><strong>How to participate in the NYAA Programme? </strong>
<br>Young people who have reached the age of 13 can enroll in the NYAA Bronze
Level through their school/organisation.</p>
<p>For those who have reached the age of 15, they can enroll directly in
the NYAA Silver Level.</p>
<p>For those who have reached the age of 16, they can enroll directly in
the NYAA Gold Level.</p>
<p>The cut off age for all three level of Awards is 30 years old. They must
complete and submit their reports and reflection before the age of 30 years
old to be eligible for the Award.</p>
<p>Each level of the National Youth Achievement Award is autonomous and participants
do not have to start with the lowest level of the Award. They can choose
to enter the level that is suitable for their age.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation of the New Structure</strong>
<br>The new structure will take effect from January 2018. Schools/organisations
can continue to sign up using the traditional method of filling the registration
form until the online system is ready in June 2018. The NYAA is currently
computerizing the NYAA programme and will develop an online system and
application to streamline the registration process and assist participants
in the programme.</p>
<p>The online system will be introduced to the schools/organisations once
it is ready. Meanwhile, participants can keep their own log, record and
reflection in MS Word format, Excel or any format of their choice while
participating in the activities. No record book and diary will be issued
during the initial period. The participants registered will be transferred
to the online system when it is ready.</p>
<p><strong>Developmental Report</strong>
<br>The participant is responsible for keeping their own record towards the
completion of the NYAA Programme, with the date, photos and reflections
on the activities they have partook during their learning journey. The
submission of log, reports and learning reflection can be done through
the online portal or mobile application platform. However, they have to
ensure that their submission is properly recorded and backed up to ensure
that they are not lost during the online submission. Neither the NYAA Council
nor the school/organization are responsible for the loss of records submitted
by participants.</p>
<p><strong>Authorisation of the National Youth Achievement Award</strong>
<br>Once the participants have completed and fulfilled the basic requirements
of the three components (for Bronze and Silver Level); or four components
(for Gold Level), with reports and records duly submitted to the NYAA Council
for verification and endorsement, a certificate will be awarded by the
National Youth Achievement Award Council.</p>
