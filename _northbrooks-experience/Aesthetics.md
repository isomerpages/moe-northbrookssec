Aesthetics
==========

### Introduction
------------

  

Etymologically originating from the Greek word αἰσθητικός (aisthētikós), aesthetics carries the meaning “of or for perception by the senses”. Exploration of this field thus entails our students cognitively exploring their concept of self and simultaneously perceive and build relationships between said self and their environs.   

  

Through dance, drama, music, literary and visual arts, aesthetics also promotes appreciation and understanding of differing cultures, values, behaviours and attitudes that underpin society. This leads to the formulation of a contemplative practitioner, which should be our end goal.

### Arts Policy in Northbrooks Secondary School
-------------------------------------------

  

The Aesthetics Committee aims to **develop and cultivate an arts appreciation amongst the Brooksian population** while at the same time, **flourish a vibrant culture of the arts in school**.

  

Based on Northbrooks Strategy Map for 2019 to 2023, the Aesthetics domain adopts three approaches to its programming i.e., **Exposure, Engagement and Empowerment (3E Approach)**, as shown below.
