On 31st October 2011, a group of 29 CCA student leaders led by our Vice-Principal, Mr Oliver Junus together with 1 Head of Department (Ms Chua Mei Hui) and 2 teachers (Ms Loh Mew Chew and Mrs Thar Cai Ting) took the inaugural Silk Air’s (MI954) direct flight from Singapore to Changsha, Hunan to visit our partner school - Nanya Middle school.

Upon arrival at Changsha, the Brooksians were warmly welcomed by the School Leaders, party secretary, key personnel, teachers and students from Nanya Middle School. During the 6 days of stay, the student leaders had an opportunity to understand the culture and history of Changsha through the various programmes organized by our partner school, for instance, the students’ homestay programme with the local students’ families and the visits to various museums and places of interest. The student leaders also had an opportunity to attend lessons and be involved in hands-on activities such as the orienteering programme which involved the subject discipline of Geography and Physical Education.  

In addition, the team visited two other schools, namely Yali-Bei Ya Middle School and Yali-Yuhua Middle School where they had the opportunity to interact with the local students through their special programmes such as the social-emotional lesson and the creation of unique patterns on table mat using tie-dye method.

Furthermore, the student leaders were involved in a Community Involvement Programme (CIP) in Changsha where they went to a rural village school - Guangming Primary School to teach the local students basic English. Through the CIP, the student leaders exhibited teamwork, empathy and fortitude as they worked in teams to engage and teach the primary school students basic English. It was a meaningful CIP for the student leaders as well as a valuable learning experience for the students of Guangming Primary School as it was the first time a foreign school had visited them. This meaningful event was subsequently featured in their local newspaper.

In a short span of 6 days, many close friendships were forged and this was evident through the farewell party on the last night held in Nanya Middle School’s cultural hall. It was a teary occasion for many as they bid farewell to their friends in Nanya Middle School.

The vice-principal, teachers and students had a fruitful and meaningful stay in Changsha which would not have been made possible without the help of our partner school. The School Leaders, teachers and students of Northbrooks Secondary School would like to express their heartfelt thanks to the School Leaders and organising committee of Nanya Middle School for their hospitality and graciousness during our stay in Changsha.
