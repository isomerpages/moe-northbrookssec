Centrestage 2022
================

In alignment with our school's aesthetic objectives, Centrestage will be a platform to: 

*   develop interest and appreciation of the arts. 
*   provide exposure and experience to different art forms. 
*   build discipline, resilience, ownership and self-motivation through an engagement in the arts. 

This year's Centrestage has an exciting array of performances by students and our very own Performing Arts CCAs.

It will be held on the **27th October 2022, 6.30pm in our school hall**. The night will be an opportunity to bring together our loved ones and supporters of the Northbrooks' family.
