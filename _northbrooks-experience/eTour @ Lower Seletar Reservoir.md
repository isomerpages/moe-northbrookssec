In Northbrooks, we grow our Champions to make an impact to the community. To do that, one of the programmes that the Mother Tongue Languages Department planned and executed is the Water Learning Programme. This programme started in 2013 and has been a good platform for students to learn about how water has been an important resource for Singaporeans. By exposing the students to the importance of saving this precious resource, we are instilling values such as empathy.

  

We are heartened to extend this programme to the public for you to have a first-hand experience in what our students are going through in the Water Learning Programme lessons. This 360 e-Tour were officially launched on 9th April 2021, during Speech Day 2021, where we celebrated the schoolâ€™s 21st anniversary.

  

Throughout the course of this 360 e-Tour, not only will you be able to have a 360 view of the Lower Seletar Reservoir, you will also be able to hear our student guides sharing on the different aspect of the reservoir, and the importance of water conservation.
