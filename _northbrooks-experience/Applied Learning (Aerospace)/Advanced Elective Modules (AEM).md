Advanced Elective Modules (AEM)
===============================

This module provided students with an understanding of how an airport handles its arrivals and departures as well as how an air traffic controller operates in his or her dynamic environment.

  

The students also got the opportunity to learn air traffic control in a simulated game-based environment in the Virtual Aerodrome Laboratory. They were able to practice radio-telephony procedures as used by Air Traffic Controllers. At the end of the module, they were trained to fulfill the roles and responsibilities of an Air Traffic Controller.
