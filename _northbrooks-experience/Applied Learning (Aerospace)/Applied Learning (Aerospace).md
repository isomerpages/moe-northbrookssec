Applied Learning (Aerospace)
============================

The Northbrooks Aerospace Programme is broad-based, equipping all students with basic knowledge in general aerospace topics and requisite ICT skills, with the objective of raising students’ awareness of and arousing their interest in the local aerospace industry, an industry which is experiencing rapid growth, as evidenced by the many career opportunities.  
  
With close partnerships with the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), Republic Polytechnic (RP), Temasek Polytechnic (TP), and leading Aerospace companies like ST Aerospace, the programme provides students with holistic learning experiences and aims to open a pathway for students with the inclination and necessary aptitude, to make a career choice in the aerospace industry, by giving them an edge when applying for aerospace-related courses in Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs).  
  
The programme adopts an applied learning approach. It provides an avenue for hands-on, practical learning that offers a contrast to academic learning in school.
