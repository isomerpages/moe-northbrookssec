Inter-class competitions
========================

All Secondary 2 classes had to go through a Flight Simulation enrichment programme. 3 students from each class were selected to compete in an inter-class competition. The intent of the program is to expose the students to basic flying and to draw parallels between classroom teaching and the real world context. The program also interlinks basic aviation theories with maths and science theories.

Interclass Flight Simulation Competition
----------------------------------------

#### On 21 March 2016

For 10 weeks in Term 1, all Sec 2 Express and Normal Academic students went through the ALP curriculum on Flight Simulation, which is Part 1 of the Sec 2 curriculum. At the end of this module on Flight Simulation, 4 students were selected from each class to represent their class in an inter-class competition. These students were selected based on Class Assessment and their passion towards learning. The competition was not open to the members of the Youth Flying Club CCA.

The students worked in pairs, comprising pilot and co-pilot. The competition required the students to fly using real-life navigation charts, to plan and land their planes at the stipulated destination within the shortest possible time.

Developed and run without the help of a vendor, the competition was held at Comp Lab 2, with the YFC students providing necessary support. It was an excellent learning experience for the YFC students too.

The following results are the results of the competition:

**Module Content**

The main aim of the programme module is to expose the students to basic flying and to draw parallels between classroom teaching and the real world. The programme also interweaves basic aviation theories with mathematics and science theories. Some of the key learning components are:

*   Introduction to basic aircraft parts/component
*   Basic Aircraft Flight Instruments/Avionics usage
*   Basic Flight Aerodynamics
*   Flight control/manoeuvres - Take-off, climb, cruise, descent, landing
*   Basic Navigation & Map Reading
