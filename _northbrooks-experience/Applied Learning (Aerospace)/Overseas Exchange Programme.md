## Youth Mission to Mars (13-17 June)


#### On 28 June 2016


  
The Youth Mission to Mars is a cross-cultural initiative sponsored by the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs and administered by the American Alliance of Museums. The Project was jointly run by Science Centre Singapore, Space Center Houston and Cité de l’espace in their respective home communities of Singapore, Houston and Toulouse.  
  

#### Programme Objectives

<i>The Project aims to</i>

1.  <i>raise awareness on the global challenges of living in an environment with finite resources.</i>
2.  <i>promote cross-cultural exchange and collaboration</i>
3.  <i>promote critical thinking and hone interpersonal and communication skills.</i>

#### About the Project

Singapore students worked with other international students in teams of 5 on a mission to establish a new human base on an uninhabited Mars. The teams investigated scientific and cultural aspects constituting a human base and design products or processes in the areas of air, water, energy and nutrition, to support human life on Mars.
