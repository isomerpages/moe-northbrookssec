Learning for Life (Outdoor Education)
=====================================

### Outdoor Education: A.C.E. Programme (A.C.E - Adventure, Character, Environment)
----------------------------------------
##### LLP Student Outcomes

The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) committee oversees the delivery of lessons in Outdoor Education (OE) and provides opportunities for stretch programmes across three tiers. The Northbrooks OE curriculum’s design aligns with our subject’s national syllabus and policies such as 21st Century Competencies and the Singapore Teaching Practice (STP). Our vision is for every Brooksian to be a physically active individual who is an advocate for the environment. In addition, it is our hope that every Brooksian graduate will possess values of adaptability and resilience to impact the community.

#### OE in PE Lessons

Students undergo a series of modular activities in their three-year outdoor education curriculum. In Secondary One, they acquire navigational skills through orienteering in the school as well as the neighbourhood parks. They participate in activities such as tent-pitching and outdoor cooking as part of our Environmental Education focus in Secondary Two. Finally, our Brooksians undergo a 5-week cycling module to prepare for their outdoor adventure level camp in Secondary Three. Students also experience a unique rock-climbing and abseiling module that is conducted at the school’s facilities conducted by the PE teachers. 

####  Level Camps

Brooksians participate in annual level camps from Secondary One to Three across various locations. Through activities such as Kayaking, Cycling and Trekking, they learn to care for the environment and develop positive character traits.  

In Secondary One, our Brooksians participate in activities based in and around the school’s campus. In Secondary Two, they are exposed to activities held at a local campsite. In Secondary Three, they embark on an outdoor adventure camp at Pulau Ubin or an overseas campsite to experience outdoors in a novel setting.  
 
#### Post Exam Activities

Brooksians are exposed to the activity of Orienteering during the Post-Exam period. They are brought to parks around Singapore, such as Sembawang, Bishan and Jurong Lake Park to experience navigating in those new settings.  

#### External Competitions and Learning Journeys

Brooksians who desire greater challenge in outdoor adventure skills are given the opportunity to go for external learning journeys and expeditions such as trekking, kayaking and cycling expeditions. Students who are identified to be competent in Orienteering are also afforded the chance to represent the school and country in overseas competitions such as the Asian Junior Youth Orienteering Championships.
