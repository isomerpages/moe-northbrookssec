<h3>Outdoor Education: A.C.E. Programme (A.C.E - Adventure, Character, Environment)</h3>
<hr>
<h5>LLP Student Outcomes</h5>
<p>The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) committee oversees the delivery
of lessons in Outdoor Education (OE) and provides opportunities for stretch
programmes across three tiers. The Northbrooks OE curriculum’s design aligns
with our subject’s national syllabus and policies such as 21st Century
Competencies and the Singapore Teaching Practice (STP). Our vision is for
every Brooksian to be a physically active individual who is an advocate
for the environment. In addition, it is our hope that every Brooksian graduate
will possess values of adaptability and resilience to impact the community.</p>

education curriculum. In Secondary One, they acquire navigational skills
through orienteering in the school as well as the neighbourhood parks.
They participate in activities such as tent-pitching and outdoor cooking
as part of our Environmental Education focus in Secondary Two. Finally,
our Brooksians undergo a 5-week cycling module to prepare for their outdoor
adventure level camp in Secondary Three. Students also experience a unique
rock-climbing and abseiling module that is conducted at the school’s facilities
conducted by the PE teachers.</p>
<h4>Level Camps</h4>
<p>Brooksians participate in annual level camps from Secondary One to Three
across various locations. Through activities such as Kayaking, Cycling
and Trekking, they learn to care for the environment and develop positive
character traits.</p>
<p>In Secondary One, our Brooksians participate in activities based in and
around the school’s campus. In Secondary Two, they are exposed to activities
held at a local campsite. In Secondary Three, they embark on an outdoor
adventure camp at Pulau Ubin or an overseas campsite to experience outdoors
