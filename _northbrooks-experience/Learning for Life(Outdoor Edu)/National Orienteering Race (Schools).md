National Orienteering Race (Schools)
=========================================

Northbrooks Secondary School has been organising the National Orienteering Race (Schools) since 2016 in partnership with Orienteering Federation Singapore. The race has served as a platform for students to apply their navigational skills acquired in the PE syllabus in a fun and competitive setting.  
 

In partnership with external organisations, we have hosted the race at local polytechnics and Passion Wave outlets. The race has seen a large number of participants from primary, secondary schools and junior colleges. The school leverages this race as a platform for Brooksians to impact the national community and develop event organisational skills.
