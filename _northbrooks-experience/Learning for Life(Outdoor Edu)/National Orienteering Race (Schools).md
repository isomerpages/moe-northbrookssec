<p>Northbrooks Secondary School has been organising the National Orienteering
Race (Schools) since 2016 in partnership with Orienteering Federation Singapore.
The race has served as a platform for students to apply their navigational
skills acquired in the PE syllabus in a fun and competitive setting.</p>
<p>In partnership with external organisations, we have hosted the race at
local polytechnics and Passion Wave outlets. The race has seen a large
number of participants from primary, secondary schools and junior colleges.
The school leverages this race as a platform for Brooksians to impact the
national community and develop event organisational skills.</p>
