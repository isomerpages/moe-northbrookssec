Stained Glass Art
=================

Stained Glass Art has been a signature programme in Northbrooks since 2002. The signature programme is conducted during Secondary One Art lessons as part of the Art curriculum. As an art form, it provides an authentic platform for nurturing Habits of Mind such as “Persisting”, “Striving for Accuracy & Precision” and “Create, Imagine, Innovate”. Students working in teams develop fortitude and resilience and learn to value each other’s strengths.

  

Each stained glass piece is positioned to be a special gift of love from conceptualisation to the final product.  Based on a theme-specified, students exercise their creativity to develop pretty stained glass art pieces.

  

The Visual Arts Unit takes part actively in Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Art Exhibition. Our works will be available for viewing in a printed catalogue and E-catalogue. Here are some of our past entries. Please enjoy.
