<p>Stained Glass Art has been a signature programme in Northbrooks since
2002. The signature programme is conducted during Secondary One Art lessons
as part of the Art curriculum. As an art form, it provides an authentic
platform for nurturing Habits of Mind such as “Persisting”, “Striving for
Accuracy &amp; Precision” and “Create, Imagine, Innovate”. Students working
in teams develop fortitude and resilience and learn to value each other’s
strengths.</p>
<p>Each stained glass piece is positioned to be a special gift of love from
conceptualisation to the final product.&nbsp; Based on a theme-specified,
students exercise their creativity to develop pretty stained glass art
pieces.</p>
<p>The Visual Arts Unit takes part actively in Singapore Youth Festival (SYF)
Art Exhibition. Our works will be available for viewing in a printed catalogue
and E-catalogue. Here are some of our past entries. Please enjoy.</p>
