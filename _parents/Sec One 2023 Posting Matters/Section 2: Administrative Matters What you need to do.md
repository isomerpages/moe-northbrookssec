### Step 2a: RIASEC Survey
----------------------

*   The RIASEC self-assessment tool allows us to <b>better understand</b> students’ personality, strength and work values.

*   The information from the survey will provide us with more opportunities to <b>better guide and support them</b> in exploring their career aspirations

*   Education and Career Guidance (ECG) programmes <b>can also be better tailored and planned</b> by taking into consideration the students’ preferences.

*   The survey data will enable them to explore their passions and pursue their areas of interest where possible
