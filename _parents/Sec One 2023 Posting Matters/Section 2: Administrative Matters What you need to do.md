All incoming Secondary 1 students who have been posted to Northbrooks Secondary School are officially enrolled in the school from the day of posting. There is no need for registration to confirm your child/ward’s enrolment.

### Step 2a: RIASEC Survey
----------------------

*   The RIASEC self-assessment tool allows us to <b>better understand</b> students’ personality, strength and work values.

*   The information from the survey will provide us with more opportunities to <b>better guide and support them</b> in exploring their career aspirations

*   Education and Career Guidance (ECG) programmes <b>can also be better tailored and planned</b> by taking into consideration the students’ preferences.

*   The survey data will enable them to explore their passions and pursue their areas of interest where possible

<i><b>(Applicable to some students)</b></i>

Some sec 1 NA and NT students will be eligible to take more demanding subjects through Subject Based Banding.  This means that NA students may take Exp subjects and NT students may take NA and Exp subjects.  <b>Parents/Guardians will receive a notification via Parents Gateway or phone call if your child is eligible by 22 Dec 2022.</b>  Students can choose if they want to accept this offer.  Upon accepting the offer, the students can proceed to purchase books for the subject at a higher level.
