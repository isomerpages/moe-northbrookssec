Dear Parents and Guardians, 

  

Welcome to Northbrooks Secondary School! 

  

We are sure that you and your child/ward are very excited to start this new chapter of his or her life and we are equally excited to welcome you into our Brooksian family.

  

To help you and your child/ward transition into secondary school, we have compiled a list of answers to some of the questions that you may find useful. We have complied a list of [<b>FAQs</b>](/files/FAQ_20%20Dec%202022.pdf) that you may find useful.

  

For your convenience, you may wish to download our [<b>Secondary One Posting Checklist</b>](/files/Checklist_20%20Dec%202022.pdf) to have an overview of the various submission deadlines.

  

<b>There are 4 Sections to complete the Sec 1 registration.</b>
