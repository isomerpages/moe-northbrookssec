<p>In line with this vision, we set the following objectives:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>To play an active role in our&nbsp;programmes</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>To establish a bridge between school management and faculty with parents.</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>To provide appreciation and recognition for parents and school staff who are active and supportive in PSG activities/programmes</strong> We
sincerely welcome you to join us as a member and if possible, volunteer
a little of your time and expertise to help make the educational experience
for our children better. Membership is free and all you need is to have
a child who is a student at Northbrooks Secondary School.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By being a PSG member, you will reap many benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be kept informed of the latest development in Northbrooks Secondary School
through our bi-monthly meetings and dialogue with the Principal and Vice
Principals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have the opportunity to provide your feedback and share ideas – thereby
contributing to change that will bring about positive growth and development
of the school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attend workshops at no cost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your journey as a parent would be more fulfilling because:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You build your network of friends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your family participates in activities that will bring you closer together.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Jesse Jackson, American Civil Rights Activist, once said: “Your children
need your presence more than your presents.” So come join us and let’s
make a difference together!</p>
