One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed computing device or Personal Learning Device (PLD).</p><p>Every Brooksian will be using the <strong>Apple iPad </strong>&nbsp;as their personal learning device. Every iPad will come bundled with the pencil and keyboard to maximise the affordances of the iPad as a learning tool. Lessons in the curriculum and co-curriculum will be designed intentionally to allow students to have the opportunity to apply their digital literacy, as we enable them to be future-ready in a digital world.</p><p>To reduce out-of-pocket cash from students, Singapore citizen students can use their Edusave account to pay for the PLD. For students on financial assistance, further subsidies will be provided. Currently, most students will be able to pay through their Edusave without paying any cash. The purchase process for 202 sec 1 students will happen in Term 1, 2024. More information will be provided in January 2024.</p><p></p><p>In the meantime, you may click on the link below to access the 1 to 1 device page where you can find videos, letters and information sheet created in 2022 for our current students. Within each letter and information sheet, there are frequently asked questions section as well.

This is in line with Northbrooks Mission to imbue in Brooksians a growth learning mindset, rooted in values and impacts the community, so as to better prepare the students for the future.</p><p>Blended Learning refers to the model of integrating Home-Based Learning (HBL) as a regular feature in the schooling experience. It constitutes a seamless learning experience, with days when students learn in school, and days (which could be termed as “Independent Learning Days”*) when students can learn at home.</p><p>Through blended learning, we hope to nurture self-directed and independent learners and develop passionate and intrinsically motivated learners who possess the desire and passion to learn for life.</p><h3>5.
