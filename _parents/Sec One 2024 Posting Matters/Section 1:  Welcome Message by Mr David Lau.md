Section 1: Welcome Message by Mr David Lau
==========================================

Dear Parents and Sec One students (2023 intake)

  

Thank you for choosing Northbrooks Secondary, and a very warm welcome to our Northbrooks Family.

  

In Northbrooks Secondary, we aim to inculcate in our students (Brooksians) the&nbsp;<b>Champion Learning Mindset</b>&nbsp;– one where there is a strong desire to learn and improve, and to bounce back in the face of adversities. Imbued with this growth mindset, we are confident that Brooksians will possess grit and resilience, and develop a “try-fail-try” spirit in all that they do, and learn and innovate each time towards success. Our school motto, "<b>Soaring Yet Rooted</b>”, challenges Brooksians to soar to greater heights whilst staying rooted in values.

  

In fostering the culture of Care and Growth at Northbrooks Secondary, our team of dedicated staff will work alongside you and your child to provide the necessary support and guidance, to equip him/her with the skills, dispositions and mindset to thrive in the new environment. We look forward to the strong home-school partnership to give your child a meaningful and enriching secondary school experience.

  

I wish everyone a wonderful and fulfilling year in 2023.
