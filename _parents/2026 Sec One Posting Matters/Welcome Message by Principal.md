<p>A very warm welcome to our Northbrooks</p>
<p>family!</p>
<p>We are grateful that you are joining us in</p>
<p>our journey to strengthen our Secondary</p>
<p>One students in Brooksian school values:</p>
<p>Graciousness, Integrity, Fortitude,</p>
<p>Teamwork, Empathy, Discipline (or in short,</p>
<p>G.I.F.T.E.D). In living by our school motto</p>
<p>“Soaring Yet Rooted,” we motivate our</p>
<p>students to achieve greater heights, while</p>
<p>remaining deeply grounded in these school</p>
<p>values.</p>
<p>Our school vision, “Every Brooksian a</p>
<p>Champion, Impacting the Community”, is</p>
<p>our commitment to unlock the full</p>
<p>potential of every student. Champions are</p>
<p>not merely students who excel in their</p>
<p>academic or co-curricular pursuits.</p>
</th>
<th rowspan="3" colspan="1">
<p>Champions are role models who</p>
<p>demonstrate exemplary values and have a</p>
<p>positive impact on the people around</p>
<p>them. We are proud of our culture of care</p>
<p>and growth towards nurturing our students</p>
<p>to be Champions.</p>
<p>Raising a child takes a village, and we</p>
<p>cannot achieve this vision without the</p>
<p>strong and respectful support from our</p>
<p>parents and guardians. Your</p>
<p>encouragement and affirmation of our</p>
<p>Brooksians, active involvement in school</p>
<p>activities, and open communication with</p>
<p>our school, are all important aspects in our</p>
<p>partnership to develop our students</p>
<p>holistically.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Northbrooks family, I wish</p>
<p>all of you a wonderful and fulfilling year in</p>
<p>2026.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Principal</p>
<p>Mr Edmund Chen</p>
