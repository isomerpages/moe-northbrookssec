he/she receives the Secondary One posting results on 19 Dec 2025?

<br>Students do not need to report to their posted secondary schools upon
receiving their Secondary One posting results. Students should refer to
the school website for more information such as Secondary One&nbsp;booklist,
purchase of books and uniforms within the school, and other details that
Secondary One students should take note of.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parents/Guardians of the incoming Secondary One students who are on Parents
Gateway (PG), will also receive information from the schools that their
children are posted to, on 19 Dec 2025.&nbsp;</p>
