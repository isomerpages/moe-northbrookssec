<p><strong>How are Posting Groups different from the N(T), N(A) and Express streams?</strong>&nbsp;
<br>Posting Groups are only used for the purposes of admitting students into
secondary schools and to guide the initial subject levels that students
offer at the start of Secondary One.</p>
<p>Once in school, students will be organised in mixed form classes and will
spend about a third of their curriculum time taking six Common Curriculum
subjects together i.e, Art, Character and Citizenship Education (CCE),
Design and Technology (D&amp;T), Food and Consumer Education (FCE), Music
and Physical Education (PE).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What are the compulsory subjects at the lower secondary level?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>All students are required to offer the following subjects in lower secondary:</p>
• English Language (EL)
<p>• Mother Tongue Languages<sup>1 </sup>(MTL)</p>
<p>• Humanities<sup>2</sup> (HUM)</p>
<p>• Mathematics (MA)</p>
<p>• Science (SCI)</p>
<p>• Common Curriculum Subjects (Art, CCE, D&amp;T, FCE, Music, PE)<br><br>
	<sup>1</sup><em>Eligible students may offer HMTL instead of MTL.</em></p>
<p><sup>2</sup><em>G1 Humanities comprises Social Studies and Humanities Exposure Module (HEMs) in Geography, History and Literature in English. G2/G3 Humanities comprises three separate subjects in Geography, History and Literature in English.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What are the subjects being offered at More Demanding Levels?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>At the start of Secondary One, students will offer EL, MTL, MA and SCI
at the subject level determined by their PSLE scores. Students who offer
most subjects at G1 or G2 are eligible to offer EL, MTL, MA and SCI at
a more demanding level from the start of Secondary One if they have performed
well in these subjects at the PSLE. Parents will be informed of their children’s
eligibility via Parents Gateway.</p>
<p>Humanities subjects can only be offered at a more demanding level from
Secondary Two.</p>

are held in school during curriculum time. Higher Tamil Language lessons
are conducted at designated language centres (once a week) after curriculum
hours (approximately 3 hours). More information will be given to your child/ward
within the first two weeks of school.</p>
<p>For lessons that are conducted at external venues (HML, HTL, AEP, MEP,
