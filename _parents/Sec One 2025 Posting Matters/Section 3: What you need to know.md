<h3>3.&nbsp; Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP)</h3>

</div>
<p>At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National
Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools and Institutes of Higher
Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the
components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital
Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every
secondary school student will own a school-prescribed computing device
or Personal Learning Device (PLD).</p>
<p>Every Brooksian will be using the <strong>Apple iPad </strong>&nbsp;as
their personal learning device. Every iPad will come bundled with the pencil
and keyboard to maximise the affordances of the iPad as a learning tool.
Lessons in the curriculum and co-curriculum will be designed intentionally
to allow students to have the opportunity to apply their digital literacy,
as we enable them to be future-ready in a digital world.</p>
<p>To reduce out-of-pocket cash from students, Singapore citizen students
can use their Edusave account to pay for the PLD. For students on financial
assistance, further subsidies will be provided. Currently, most students
will be able to pay through their Edusave without paying any cash. More
information will be provided in January 2025.</p>

<h3>4.&nbsp; Blended Learning (BL)</h3>
<hr>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>Blended Learning builds on Singapore’s education reform – “Learn for Life”
movement – to build stronger abilities, skills and habits for independent
and lifelong learning. This is in line with Northbrooks Mission to imbue
in Brooksians a growth learning mindset, rooted in values and impacts the
community, so as to better prepare the students for the future.</p>
<p>Blended Learning refers to the model of integrating Home-Based Learning
(HBL) as a regular feature in the schooling experience. It constitutes
a seamless learning experience, with days when students learn in school,
and days (which could be termed as “Independent Learning Days”*) when students
can learn at home.</p>
<p>Through blended learning, we hope to nurture self-directed and independent
learners and develop passionate and intrinsically motivated learners who
possess the desire and passion to learn for life.</p>
